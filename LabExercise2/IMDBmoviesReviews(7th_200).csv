"1","The Zone of Interest","Xstal","8/10","31 January 2024","There's a house that looks and feels like any other, with a mother and her children who are brothers - and there's a wall around this plot, the other side people are not, and they will not get the chance, to rediscover. As the father is the commandant of death, responsible for taking their last breath, though he lives without a care, just like his wife who loves it there, and it's clear they're very proud, of their success. After all, you have to have a certain mind, to exterminate a race of humankind, and then live a normal life, without guilt, or strain, or strife, in a house, with a big wall, to hide behind."," Gets Under the Skin..."
"2","The Zone of Interest","SoumikBanerjee1996","8/10","9 March 2024","The medium of 'Cinema' is widely recognized as a means of visual storytelling, where a series of moving images move the narrative forward, with background sound playing a secondary role. However, there are instances where the audio takes control of the sequences and defies conventionality.Jonathan Glazer's ""The Zone of Interest"" serves as a prime example of this phenomenon. The director skilfully employs a variety of sounds, such as the constant arrivals of trains, gunshots, and the burning of chimneys, creating an atmosphere that is undeniably terrifying.Whilst there are a few noteworthy cinematographic elements, including effective use of juxtaposition, it is the background score and sound design that bear the brunt of the storytelling.For those interested in watching this film in the comfort of their homes, I would personally recommend finding the quietest possible environment, utilizing proper sound systems or headphones (preferably noise-canceling ones), and try to watch the entire thing in one sitting, without interruptions.Trust me, this approach will significantly enhance your perception of the film.However, it is important to note that the film heavily relies on visual as well as auditory 'insinuations,' such as suggestive sounds and framings, to convey its message. As a result, individuals who are might be unfamiliar with historical events, particularly those lacking knowledge of ""The Holocaust,"" may struggle to grasp these subtleties.In essence, it is not a readily accessible feature for all viewers out there. Bear that in mind."," Impeccable sound design!"
"3","The Zone of Interest","deanosuburbia","8/10","27 January 2024","The Zone of Interest starts off with a black screen which is rather disconcerting and from this point on the tone is set for a film which shows some of the horrors of Auschwitz concentration camp. Once this black screen makes way we are introduced to Rudolf and Hedwig Höss and their family as they enjoy a sun drenched picnic in the countryside. Rudolf Höss was the longest-serving commandant of Auschwitz concentration and extermination camp. Rudolf and Hedwig have their family home next to Auschwitz seemingly living their best normal life just feet away from the atrocities taking place nearby. In this house they have nice furnishings, a swimming pool and beautiful flowers in a picturesque garden. The couple are not always self aware that they are monsters as they parade themselves as if conducting purely normal duties, Hedwig particularly proud of being ""Queen of Auschwitz"". The sound design is outstanding as the events over the wall are detailed with a subtlety which is very realistic and distressing. This film is one I won't rewatch on many occasions as it was clearly a disturbing story which was directed with great detail. The background scenes of smoke billowing in the distance and trains arriving add to the horrific nature set against the innocence of the young children who live next door. The end credit music was very jarring, clearly there to make sure you don't forget this cinematic experience in a hurry."," Subtle Horror"
"4","The Zone of Interest","FlashCallahan","8/10","5 February 2024","There are films that are excellent, and you recommend them to people, and you can watch them over and over again. Then there are films that are excellent, but you never want to see them again, and they are very hard to recommend.The Zone Of Interest falls into the latter part of that sentence.It's a remarkable film, with a hideous backdrop. The Hoss family are living a subliminal suburban life, with an idyllic house, servants, and the kids have a wonderful education. But, they happen to live right next to Auschwitz.Glazer is a phenomenal film maker, and whilst I didn't like Under The Skin, the guerilla film making in that movie was genius, and here, he puts cameras in different places in the house and turns it to impromptu performance from the cast. Obviously not all of it is impromptu, but it's a Marvel turn from Glazer, and it makes the film feel more real.But then as the film progresses, the background becomes the main character, and much like the Hoss family, there is no getting away from the fact that diabolical things are happening beyond the eye.And this turns the idyllic life for the family into something else. Are they ignorant? Are they Embarrassed? Or are they as monstrous as the beasts that are working in the camp?So, as I've already said, it's a remarkable piece of work, with some shocking sequences (the scene at the river is grotesque), but like Come And See, it's really hard to recommend, and I have no desire to see it again."," The life we enjoy is very much worth the sacrifice....."
"5","The Zone of Interest","shashank_1501","8/10","9 March 2024","What comes in mind after hearing Auschwitz? You would say concentration camps, Extermination centers, genocide, starved Jews getting tortured and many more such references. But one can just not think of Rudolf Höss, The commandant of Auschwitz and his wife Hedwig seemingly living their dream in a house build next to the camp where all those atrocities were taking place.This Jonathan Glazer's film is one of a kind movie in which you'll only hear the references of holocaust in background noises that reverberates in your head for hours after the movie. The way in which the commandant family is shown living their normal life when human being are being burnt alive just feet away will surely give you chills.Sandra Hüller gives yet another thrilling performance after Anatomy of a Fall (also nominated for Oscars). Playing the commandant's wife Hedwig she portrays a cold and ruthless lady so consumed in her own world that she's completely ignorant towards the noises and smoke from the furnaces of these extermination camps.This Glazer's epic deserves recognition and it's about time the Oscars reward one of, if not the most, audacious films of the year."," Unlike anything before"
"6","The Zone of Interest","cfsgen","8/10","24 February 2024","This film might give a perspective into what life was like during that time period and how everyday Germans livedI have just visited Auschwitz so timing of this movie was very well placed. Like I am sure many before me, my visit left me coming away with many questions that people cannot answer, but the biggest one is really how could such an operation have taken place? How did the nazis gat away with it for so long?This film shows in part why, how Auschwitz and the camps around it provided a lifestyle for some German families. How the horrors that went on were ignored and excused and although people knew, they didn't question.Unlike other, similar films, this has a very cold feel to it. As life with the family goes on like any other family, you see or hear glimpses of the horrors continually taking place, but these are not at the forefront of daily life, this is just background noise to the families other issues, the contrast is starkI don't think this movie is for everyone, it's not action packed and lacks the Hollywood feel many will want, but it depicts an important image, one which everyone should see, but not to understand."," If you ever wondered 'how did they get away with it...."""
"7","The Zone of Interest","julius-maerz","8/10","12 February 2024","The zone of interest is an incredibly creative new take on a topic that has been part of the cultural consciousness for decades. I have to applaud the filmmakers for showing the unimaginable horrors of the hollocaust without actually showing it. Instead, we follow the family of Rudolf Höss, the man in charge of the Auschwitz concentration camp, and how they go about their daily lives. They live in a spatious home, with a beautiful garden that happens to be located right next to the concentration camp. Like one of their garden walls is literally the prison wall. Throughout the movie, we never catch a look insight of the camp walls, but while the children enjoy a summer day in the family pool, we hear the occasional shots in the background throughout the movie. We hear screams of prisoners and guards alike. And of course, we see the constant flames and the smoke coming out of the ovens in which the bodies of thousands of people are turned to ashes. It creates a surreal but captivating atmosphere of happy family life right next to torture and death, that they are in a major part responsible for. The only criticism that I have is that the movie doesn´t really have a plot that advances the story, so it just becomes 100 minues of drawing out the same idea. It is still a good movie, but as a 30 or 45 minute short film, it would have worked perfectly."," Would have been the perfect short film"
"8","The Zone of Interest","titley-02065","8/10","9 March 2024","Zone of Interest is an unusual film in that it's more a meditation on evil than a traditional feature film drama.As a traditional feature film it's a bit slow, lacks character development (outside the main character), is a tad self-consciously arty, and repetitive - early on I found myself thinking, ""yeah, I get it, let's move it along"".But taken as a piece of art or a meditation, it's original, chilling, immersive, harrowing, and darkly beautiful. Those initial concerns about pacing soon disappeared as I found myself horrified by the juxtaposition of the uncaring, brutal mundanity of the Commandant's family life just outside the camp, and the unimaginable, unseen horrors that were happening literally metres away inside the camp. This is one of those rare films that has me still thinking about it a week after I saw it.Worth seeing so you can make up your own mind."," More like a meditation on evil than a traditional drama"

And as you begin to think, how can they live like this. It shows that, they enjoy it, and that they are actually Nazis and horrible people.The oldest son wants to be the commander of Auschwitz when he grows up, and the youngest son, shows normality as he hears Jews punished.The movie makes you hear the horror happening while make you watch this family gloat how they've built a great home for themselves, and how they have a heater because the winter is too cold.Haunting."," I think I need a shower"

"11","The Zone of Interest","PEEZYEM","8/10","12 March 2024","Holocaust-themed films have consistently been a pivotal element of global cinema. They navigate through the darkest facets of humanity while simultaneously unveiling the most noble aspects of the human spirit. Whether showcasing the harrowing depths or the commendable heights of human conduct, these stories leave a lasting impact, garnering accolades and serving as a poignant reminder of a past that horrifies yet inspires.Jonathan Glazer's ""The Zone Of Interest"" distinguishes itself within this genre; No other film has so incisively captured the mundane nature of evil. Despite the atrocities occurring just beyond view, audible yet distant, the film presents a narrative deeply rooted in the day-to-day that feels eerily familiar.It weaves in everyday life events - from sibling rivalries and heartfelt mother-daughter conversations to chance encounters with man's best friend and brushes with authoritative bosses. These vignettes resonate with anyone familiar with the nuances of everyday life, setting a profound contrast against the backdrop of evil's banality.The performances by Sandra Hüller and Christian Friedel are nothing short of remarkable. However, their brilliance is subtly masked, as Glazer maintains a deliberate distance throughout the film. This artistic choice fosters a connection to the mundane aspects of daily life while preventing the audience from becoming overly attached to the underlying evil of the presented characters. This sense of commonality is skillfully juxtaposed with the stark contrasts of the film's setting, underscored by a haunting soundtrack orchestrated by Mica Levi and her team.The film's power is amplified by a resonant tie between past and present, culminating in the final scenes. It serves as a chilling reminder that the past, though distant, remains profoundly relevant."," The banality of evil."
"12","The Zone of Interest","spencermcook","8/10","2 February 2024","By depicting the ordinary lifestyle of Rudolf Höss (the longest-serving commandant of Auschwitz) and his family living within an arm's reach of Auschwitz, Jonathan Glazer has found a way to depict evil unlike anything I've ever seen. As horror films enhance the eeriness of their stories, ""The Zone of Interest"" showcases an abundance of audio-visual moments that are entirely discomforting and piercingly complementary to the feeling that Glazer is aiming to provoke from audience members. This is a point-of-view story that the world isn't accustomed to witnessing, and that's exactly what harnesses the pit that sits deeply inside your stomach while watching. Though the events of this film take place 80 years ago, the contentment and indifference to cruelty and inhumanity are parallel to current issues that many of us choose to ignore simply because we don't want to look. This is a cinematic experience that binds reality as close as possible, and though unconventional and off-putting in its film style, it's hard to argue against this being the most original piece of filmmaking from 2023."," Evil depicted in the most subtly powerful manner"
"13","The Zone of Interest","Jeremy_Urquhart","8/10","1 February 2024","The Zone of Interest is a very good film, but it is also hard to like or enjoy in the traditional sense. That's by design, of course, but there were aspects of it that had me at a loss. There's a particularly experimental decision it returns to a couple of times where things are shown using a thermal camera, and I didn't know what was being communicated there. Maybe that's on me being a dummy, but I felt fairly sure of what the rest of the film was trying to say. At a point, you do wonder how it could even end, and the final couple of scenes are unexpected, but I thought that was a strange direction to go in that worked. There are a couple of points earlier that had me bewildered, but that's sort of what you expect from Jonathan Glazer; the guy made Under the Skin, after all.It's certainly worth watching The Zone of Interest, and I do expect parts of it to stick with me. It tackles difficult subject matter in a detached and grim way that before today, I'd only really seen in documentaries (I'm reminded most of Shoah and the more recent The Act of Killing when watching The Zone of Interest; I guess the latter even has a similar-sounding title, now that I think about it). It's hard to know what to think overall, and giving this a rating out of five or ten feels hard as well. But I respect what it's going for, and generally understand it. This is a difficult film about difficult things, and that it was difficult to watch throughout (and kind of difficult to understand in a couple of key moments) is, perhaps, the point."," Journey into the unknown."
"14","The Zone of Interest","ntjhforesthill","8/10","21 March 2024","When evil occurs, what do the perpetrators do when they clock off? Do they pray for forgiveness? Do they have sex? Or do they just garden, worry about work, and wash and clean the clothes, choosing to believe the horrors happening close by are somehow normal, lawful, and for the best. If you became a perpetrator, what would you do?The Zone of Interest is a deeply affecting example of non-narrative cinema that will grip, terrify, and stay with audiences who are prepared to resonate with it. If you're not in the appropriate frame of mind or don't have good speakers, you will find it deathly dull.The film relies heavily on chilling and inventive sound design and music to unsettle the audience as we get to know the family and household of the commandant of Auschwitz, Rudolf Höss, and his wife, Hedwig.As imagined warbling and belching echos of industrial pain ring in our ears, we see the deeply undramatic strivings of Rudolf and Hedwig to build a dream life for their family in a house and garden next to the camp. Nothing happens that would make it onto a holiday postcard. None of the horrors of Auschwitz are shown. If you don't know about Auschwitz then this film will feel like an experimentalist audio-sensory stamina test.The camera is nearly always static and wide. The cuts are slow. The dialogue is highly naturalistic. Scenes play out with the barest hint of action, but when you know what is happening just over the wall of the garden, it creates a truly dreadful atmosphere. Horrific in the truest sense as we are presented with the fact that committing evil can be a 9-5 job, and people who are decent, like you and me, like your parents, like your children, can do truly evil and despicable things.Knowing that, how can we improve our world?"," Won't work for everyone, but well worth trying"
"15","The Zone of Interest","WooderIce64","8/10","5 March 2024","The Holocaust is a difficult thing to deal with in any medium, film included. The Zone of Interest is something rather rare, a movie about the Holocaust from the Nazi perspective. That's not to say it takes their side, it very much does the opposite. This is a movie about one man who was instrumental in the daily functioning of the death machine; Rudolph Hoss, commandant of Auschwitz, and his family as they work to create a home for themselves adjacent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. In simplest terms, this is the day to day lives of the people responsible for the atrocities.Minimalism is key here - there is very little dialogue, very little music, and the interior of the camp does not appear at all in the main story. Irrespective of what it provokes in audiences, there is very little emotion portrayed. There isn't even that much of a story, even in its fairly short runtime. It also has a certain claustrophobic rigidity. You can count on one hand the number of times the camera moves. While this is a movie with a strong message, it is not explicitly delivered or spelled out at all. Deciphering this film is closer to analyzing a painting than a more standard movie. It can be quite daunting.Ultimately, The Zone of Interest is about two things - normalization and detachment. Popular culture, back then and now, oftentimes depicts Nazis as these sort of cartoonish, comic book-esque villains. This is a film that reminds us that they were no less human than you or I. They had the same worries that many of us have - family drama, job promotion, etc. That's not to say it's trying to make excuses or anything - they know exactly what's going on. The disturbing elements of the movie are no so much as the gunshots and crematoriums in the background, but the normalcy with which it is treated.There are also several surreal sequences in this movie, and their meaning is particularly difficult to discern. For instance, the scene where the entire screen turns red. The movie opens with a solid minute of a blank, black screen. Some scenes are filmed in negative. These are kind of a deterrent, in a way not. They do break up the monotony, but the monotony is the point of the movie. The ending of the movie is... disturbing, to say the least. It feels like a horror movie scene with an inevitable jumpscare that doesn't come.The Zone of Interest is a unique film, that's for certain. Your mileage may vary. If you know what you're getting in to, then you may find some appreciation for this unusual vision."," Minimalism is Key"
"16","The Zone of Interest","scarlettbradford","8/10","3 March 2024","So... I completely agree with the reviews that say this movie is boring and lacks plot. It was tedious and felt like a chore to watch to be honest, but I think therein lies its brilliance. It felt like trying to meditate on those days when your mind is filled with feral cats. Other holocaust movies made me weep at human cruelty and loss, but this film does not provide that emotional catharsis. In its mundanity, it just forces you to sit in discomfort with nowhere to release the feelings. And shouldn't we feel that way that humanity perpetrated such horrors upon itself and frequently continues to despite having this lesson to teach us better? I want to visit the lynching museum in Montgomery, AL as well as Auschwitz one day and I know both will make me feel awful. One doesn't go to those places for fun or entertainment. One goes to bear witness in the hopes of learning and understanding. It's work. So I think this film is brave in forcing work without traditional plot devices and crescendos and valleys. To just deliver to anxious discomfort and sit in it."," I think tedious discomfort may be the point"
"17","The Zone of Interest","meclote","8/10","28 February 2024","The film emerges as a masterful cinematic exploration of the darkest recesses of human nature, presenting a narrative that is as unsettling as it is enlightening. This film dares to confront the uncomfortable truth about the normalization of atrocities within the human psyche, delivering a powerful commentary on the cruelty and individualism that can pervade human actions. Through its unflinching portrayal of life amidst one of history's greatest horrors, it forces viewers to reckon with the depth of human evil, asking, ""How far can the evil human go?"" The answer, as depicted with chilling clarity in this film, is profoundly disturbing.The performances by Christian Friedel and Sandra Hüller, as Rudolf Höss and Hedwig Höss respectively, are nothing short of phenomenal. Friedel's portrayal of Rudolf Höss is chilling, capturing the essence of a man embroiled in unspeakable evil with a terrifying detachment. Hüller, as Hedwig, embodies the smug arrogance of her unofficial title, ""Queen of Auschwitz,"" with a performance that is guaranteed to provoke a visceral reaction from the audience. Their performances bring to life the chilling reality of those who lived in the shadows of atrocity, offering a raw, unvarnished look at their characters' inhumanity.""The Zone of Interest"" also reignites the debate over the portrayal of Holocaust atrocities in media, questioning the fine line between commemoration and exploitation. By focusing on the perpetrators, the film takes a bold step in Holocaust representation, ensuring that the discussion around these narratives remains both relevant and contentious. However, it makes strides to include Jewish testimony, with a poignant coda set in the modern-day Auschwitz museum.The film's conclusion is a stark reminder of the necessity to remember and condemn the figures responsible for such horrors, ensuring they remain condemned in the darkness of history. ""The Zone of Interest"" is a compelling, thought-provoking piece that does not shy away from the complexities of its subject matter. It is a film that demands to be seen, not only for its artistic merits but for its potent reminder of the depths to which humanity can sink and the collective responsibility to remember and learn from the past."," Navigating Humanity's Darkest Chapters"
"18","The Zone of Interest","carlosernestoadam","8/10","3 April 2024","Warning: Spoilers ahead (if one can even spoil here)At first glance, The Zone of Interest is a film about a seemingly normal family living in a large house, surrounded by idyllic landscapes and a beautiful garden, going about their lives.The film lacks a coherent plot but rather resembles a family photo album filled with countless carefree memories of trips to the river, parties in their garden, and children growing up. It portrays an everyday image of a German family at the time, similar to countless others.However, the father is not just any man; he is the overseer of the Auschwitz extermination camp. The house is not just anywhere but sits right next to the towering walls of the concentration camp.While the children play in the garden, one can hear gunshots from the guards and the cries of suffering prisoners in the background. One can see black smoke billowing from the chimneys as bodies are incinerated. This juxtaposition of a seemingly happy family life in the foreground and the cruel fate of millions of Jews in the background creates a sense of comfort that has never been seen before. The irony of a blissful family life, only a hundred meters away from thousands of dying people being ruthlessly gassed, is simply cruel.The family's unrealistic worldview, especially that of the wife who bursts into tears because her husband is temporarily transferred away, contrasted with the suffering and misery of thousands of people just a hundred meters away behind the walls, reflects the insanity of the Nazi era.While many argue that this film portrays the human side of a high-ranking Nazi, The Zone of Interest actually illustrates the inhumanity and ignorance of this family. They saw the black smoke and heard the cries daily but still chose to overlook, ignore, and rationalize everything. They wanted to plant rose bushes along the wall to hide it from view. They had a beautiful garden, an idyll, next to the hell of thousands of Jews.All the war, suffering, horror, and destruction were so close yet so far for this family."," The Irony of Devils"

"20","The Zone of Interest","cricketbat","8/10","23 February 2024","Despite its seemingly mundane foreground, The Zone of Interest kept me thoroughly engaged (and horrified) by what was going on in the background. This film uses sound and visual clues to continuously echo the terrible events that occurred at the Auschwitz concentration camp without overtly saying anything. The cameras keep their distance from the characters, giving a heightened sense of realism to the story, as if you were watching the events unfold in person. I don't think I'll be watching The Zone of Interest again any time soon, but it definitely made an impression on me that I won't soon forget."," The foreground is mundane, the background is horrifying"
"21","The Zone of Interest","xgokhan","8/10","23 February 2024","This movie is exactly what I hoped it to be in many ways. A truly objective look at a horrible time in history. But a time where a manority of people still led close to normal lives, or if not, normalized what they were going through.So to assume that a portrayal of a family linked to the genocide by Nazis had to show them as inhuman monsters with foaming mouths and psychotic behavior is irrational. If you were to be transported back in time and were a fly on the wall of that house, I am certain yu would observe something quite similar to this. This does not take away from the movie's striking power.In fact, the mundaneness and the banality of this family's life and the way they normalize living on the other side of a deadly concentration camp while acting like a normal family - whatever normal means - is what makes it terrifying. Had this family been depicted as a bunch of people who talk about how much they hate Jews and how they should all be rid of nonstop, this would be shoving a message down our throat and would not sit well.Also the many reviews asking about where the other half of the story is, and why the camp behind the wall isn't shown. Sometimes what's not obvious is scarier. It is not like we do not know what happened there, and there is no reason to add more grueling scenes to score drama points and it is much more telling to leave that to the imagination of the viewer. The sound effects do that brilliantly.The only criticism I would have is - despite understanding what Glazer was trying to do - to the night vision scenes which, despite trying to add a positive side to the story, ended up seeming disjointed to me."," A snapshot"
"22","The Zone of Interest","kabbauddo","8/10","23 February 2024","The plot itself is a very simple and even beautiful daily life of a family. However, when all this happens outside the concentration camp, it shows an indescribable and huge contrast. The protagonist's family played amid the wailing sounds, planted flowers in the thick black smoke, and swam in the river with scattered bones. It's so unsettlingly depressing and terrifying that the false peace they try to maintain as a family seems inexplicably absurd and ridiculous. Previous films about the Nazis and concentration camps have mostly put the audience in the perspective of the victims, but this film gives us a glimpse into daily life in Germany during that era, and the story just takes place outside Auschwitz. As for how the characters in the film should be judged, that's a matter of opinion."," The suffocatingly absurd"
"23","The Zone of Interest","cdjh-81125","8/10","2 February 2024","First of all, a big thank you to the 3 teenagers I got sat next to for this. Who thought a foreign language, holocaust film was the right place to laugh hysterically between themselves, talk non stop and throw things at each other for the entire film.That aside thought this is one of the best films I've ever seen that I'll probably never watch again. It's so brutally effective in every way to the point where almost every shot is designed to make you feel uncomfortable in some way. It's got maybe the best use of sound I've heard from a 2023 movie (yes I do remember Oppenheimer) and it constantly left me confused about how to feel in all the right ways.It's really hard to make a good Holocaust movie because they all really need to have something unique to say about these horrific events. But I can honestly say The Zone of Interest is one of the best films I've seen in this genre. Really happy this lived up to it's massive acclaim and even if I'll never watch it again, I can't see it leaving me anytime soon."," Effective"
"24","The Zone of Interest","thomashealydavies","8/10","22 February 2024","There is little to discuss when it comes to plot and character development. But that is not what this film is about. It explores how evil human beings can be to each other and still find time to do the mundane everyday life things that we need to do. How we can become so inhuman, like robots, with our everyday, when such unspeakable brutality is happening next door.The framing is excellent. Every shot is still, like the viewer is unable to move either from fear or sheer disbelief. The sound is equally disturbing, from distance screams and sporadic gunfire to deep, soul disturbing bass.It must have been so hard to end this film. So a flash forward to the cleaners was thought provoking. No matter how much cleaning we do we will never remove this stain from humanity. As we move forward as a civilisation it is important to not forget these atrocities, but I think it is more important to reflect on our own species' capabilities rather than finger point. Modern day Germans also consider the Nazis the bad guys. They too were people. Led by evil leaders and brainwashed by propaganda. This film shows us the normality of that life, playing with the kids, eating, enjoying the weather in the garden. While enjoying the fur coats and gold teeth.I'm glad I have watched it, but like others, I do not need to see it again."," Haunting is an understatement"
"25","The Zone of Interest","masonsaul","8/10","6 February 2024","The Zone of Interest is the mundanity of evil taken to its most horrifying extreme. A film that makes intentions very clear from the beginning and then spends the next 105 minutes reinforcing that point in a harrowing fashion. It's a nightmare in cinematic form.Sandra Hüller and Christian Friedel are so good at portraying the selfishness and desensitisation of their characters. Their performances are designed to be very boring as they focus on the mundane tasks directly in front of them and completely block out everything on the other side of that fence.Jonathan Glazer's direction wisely keeps everything visually bleak and at a distance. Every shot is meticulously precise and the night vision sequences further emphasise the almost quotidian nature. Mica Levi's score is only very briefly present but whenever it's there it's unforgettable in how haunting it is.The most vital part of why this film works is definitely the sound design by Johnnie Burn. It's a soundscape which is constantly reminding you of what's going on over that fence and creating a dissonance between what you're seeing and what you're hearing that's deliberately uncomfortable."," Haunting experience"

However, this does mean the film might be considered boring or slow because there is little in the way of actual plot. Really the story consists of Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel), a Nazi commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp, who lives beside the camp with his family and his wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) who becomes upset when told he (and subsequently the family) might be transferred. The horror of the Holocaust and the crimes taking place within Auschwitz are never shown on screen, instead the sounds associated with the death and torture of the camp are only ever heard over the wall dividing the Höss family home (and garden) and Auschwitz.For this review, I was going to write about the final scene(s) because I think it's something that might divide those who like/dislike The Zone of Interest. Rudolf Hoss is back in Germany, I think, and meeting with his Nazi superiors to receive orders regarding his future in the party and employment. He is informed that he has being doing ""a good job"" and thus returning to his position at Auschwitz to oversee the arrival of many Hungarian Jews. The operation is given the name ""operation Höss"" and when Rudolf phones his wife to tell her, he is clearly very proud of the fact this will be his namesake. He then is witnessed, soon after, heading down the stairs to leave (presumably to return to Auschwitz). As he defends the stairs (of ann empty grand building) into ever increasing darkness, he stops several times as if he is about to throw up. I'm conflicted as to what this is portraying, as because until now, neither of the two main characters of Rudolf and Hedwig have shown any remorse for their actions or complicity, and so perhaps this is indeed Glazer's attempt to show Rudolf does have some remorse about his own role in the horrific Holocaust. He then stops and looks at a dark corridor where a small circle of white light is seen. The audience are then transitioned to modern day, in a jarring juxtaposition, where workers at the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum are seen opening the gates, and then cleaning, sweeping and vacuuming the floors and displays. Now, I understand that some people have taken this scene to demonstrate the true cost of what was occurring over the wall and within the confinements of the Auschwitz concentration camp because the displays show the incinerators, the empty gas chambers, and the possessions of the Jewish prisoners piled high in disregard by the Nazi's at the time. It is somber and startling because if, indeed, there is an audience to 'The Zone of Interest' who does not know what happened at Auschwitz then this is the film's chance to finally show this. However, if this was Glazer's intention alone then there is no need for him to show the displays etc alongside the cleaners going about their work.I think Glazer intentionally includes the cleaners and staff almost in an accusatory way to us as spectators of the film, visitors or ""tourists"" off Auschwitz and wider (and current) events occurring in the world. The theme of The Zone of Interest is exposing the ""banality of evil"" and in this regard, this scene serves to further this point to us. As the cleaners go about their work, they inevitably will become desensitised to their surroundings, particularly if they are working there daily, and this is not their fault. But then is Glazer asking whether Auschwitz again has become a place of banality or mundanity? Secondly, another reading of this sense, that I instantly took after seeing the film, was that instead of the museum being a place of memoralisation and reflection to those who suffered and died, is it actually in danger of us just giving evil people like Rudolf Hoss a legacy? As Rudolf looks on to, as suggested, visualise these modern day museum scenes, is he proud that we still visit it and disturbingly awe (even if in disgust) at his ""work""? Much in the same way he is proud of the operation of the Hungarian Jews being named after him? It's a difficult feeling to contend with as a viewer, and if this is the case, I don't think Glazer is saying we are doing it willingly or with a conscious evil intent, but then isn't this part of history of the holocaust, in that many people knew something was going on but they chose not to think too deeply or it was too far away, or it was too hard to stop and control under the threat of brutal authoritarianism.This is why I actually think the final scene saves the film, and ensures that Glazer has something new to say and add to a plethora of Holocaust artefacts, literature and film. But the film as whole is also teetering the line of boredom, being too symbolic and ""artsy"" for the sake of it, and thinking it is cleverer than it is when actually it is more overt than it is would like. Therefore I'm in the middle and can only give the film a 5/10."," A comment on the final scene(s)"
"27","The Zone of Interest","Tweetienator","5/10","22 February 2024","Because of the topic of The Zone of Interest, the movie automatically receives a lot of praise by the critics. But be warned - if you expect a strong story or plot, you will not get much. Certainly, in a certain sense, the movie's approach to the theme of the Holocaust is thought-provoking, but that's simply not enough for a full length movie - there are some strong pictures and scenes, but observing a family and staff doing their daily routines and stuff just can hold one's attention so far (at least mine) - some scenes are overlong and just bored me a lot. What else? Production and cast are solid on a TV-movie scale. The Zone of Interest reminds me of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas; the latter one is far more suspenseful and entertaining (despite the serious theme), and last but not least, the way better movie. Final words: an interesting experiment but just not executed (and thought thru) well enough to make a lasting impact."," A Rather Mixed Experience"
"28","The Zone of Interest","universejuice","5/10","2 February 2024","I think the ""slice of life"" approach worked well in allowing me to experience the family's utterly desensitized existence. The highlight, because it is different from all the other WWII films I have seen, was how the brutality and violence was hidden, and yet always present in my mind through the constant noises from the camp or scenes like the boy washing rudolf's boots, water and blood mixing in the sink.While the mundanity of the narrative presents a more complex evil than is found on most cinematic battlefields, it just did not provoke the reaction in me I expected, and I felt my interest quickly decreasing. I think this says less about this particular film, and much more about how I am used to this historical context being treated, or at least how it is treated in the films I have seen. As a spectacle and not as everyday life for real people."," Bored and unaffected"
"29","The Zone of Interest","AdrenalinDragon","5/10","20 January 2024","I don't get the praise for this film. It was pretty boring, and yeah I know you're seeing the side of the Nazi's family perspective with the horrors of the Holocaust happening in the background off-screen, but I just didn't feel it warranted a feature length running time and it didn't feel like there was much of a plot going. Perhaps that's the point, but it didn't hold my interest and got quite tedious and obvious. Nothing wrong on a technical or performance level. In fact, easily the best things going for it, as well as the sound. However, it just didn't feel worth the time watching knowing the obvious and not really being heavily invested in any character.5/10."," The Zone of Obvious"
"30","The Zone of Interest","V12yh4","5/10","29 January 2024","I was really looking forward to this.... primarily due to Glazer's involvement. The premise of the film was good but it just didn't make it into an involving picture....there were some artistic addendums like the coloured screens and the night vision but for me this showed that the director didn't trust the story enough and used these gimmicks to distract the viewer. It's a shame as I was really looking forward to it but it's another disappointment in cinema I've had this year. Films are overpraised now. I thought the acting was excellent and the mood was set very well. In the end I was glad it was over so maybe they could have edited it a bit more and forgot about the stylisms - it would have hit home more. I don't believe we needed to see what they did behind the walls....it was intimated enough."," Too much style and not enough substance"
"31","The Zone of Interest","Brad_G35","5/10","5 February 2024","I think I expected a bit too much out of this movie. I wanted it to hit me like a ton of bricks but it didn't do that at all.I knew the horrors of the Holocaust wouldn't be shown in this movie and that's okay. The audio in the background of things happening was enough. Constant gun fire. Screaming. All the torture going on around the clock in the background.After about 20 minutes, the background noise kind of becomes white noise. I can only imagine that the people living nearby viewed it this way too. After a while, the noise was just there.With that, it becomes a movie about this family. The male head of the family is a commander in the Nazi party that was responsible for millions of deaths. Once the background noise becomes white noise, the movie just turns into a movie about this family. You even kind of have feelings for the wife as she learns that her husband is being sent to another town.I might change my review after a future viewing but this film just didn't do it for me."," Loved the idea. Execution could've been better."
"32","The Zone of Interest","dan_c_ro","5/10","22 February 2024","Although the movie deals with a serious subject, the Holocaust, it lacks a plot and there is no character development.I cannot praise it and rate it high just because it deals with a serious matter, like most critics and viewers do.I understand what the director of the movie wanted to show, the banality of evil, but in the end the movie was just boring.As for the Holocaust subject, before blaming only the Germans for what they did let's think twice first. During the war the secret services from many countries knew about the camps and what was happening in those camps. Also, there were letters sent by some prisoners to the Vatican, so even the Catholic church and those in charge of it knew about the killings in those camps. Nobody did anything until it was too late. So, in my opinion the whole world is to blame for what happened. And we should learn from this."," Serious subject, boring movie"
"33","The Zone of Interest","Jspenx","5/10","5 March 2024","The idea is fresh. The approach is new, seeing the extreme dehumanization the characters are going through, living their daily lives right next to the concentration camp. Like a dark cloud hovering above you, the viewer, without actually raining, you hear the terrors happening just a few meters away, but you never see anything. Cries, gunshots, screams, chimneys smoking, soldiers shouting. It's dark, it's profound.And then? Nothing happens. This new narration of the holocaust is interesting, but is clearly given in the first ten minutes of the film. Plot wise, the story becomes stale, as we see a German family going on and about their daily lives, and the film becoming a complete bore before even the first half an hour passes. Huller does the best she can, grasping tight on her rise to stardom with two much discussed movies in 2023, but it's just not enough.It shouldn't be a feature film, but a short one. In 20 minutes, it had all the time it needed to convey its themes and messages and would leave the viewer satisfied. Now it overstayed its welcome and doesn't deserve the praise or the hype, even if we consider how the critics go bats about holocaust films even before watching."," It should be a short film"
"34","The Zone of Interest","cmbird64","5/10","18 February 2024","Gotta say that this film disappointed me. I understand the high praise the film has received to a point. Glazers previous film Under The Skin, which I loved, tried to show us what it means to be human. Here we're shown what it feels like to be inhumane. But this was established fairly early in the piece and for me there was no exploration of how these people got to that point. There was no arc or revelatory process to the film for me. It was simply a ""these are bad people aren't they"" story but pretty superficial sadly. The nearest comparison, Boy In The Striped Pyjamas at least wrung some emotion from the subject matter. This one left me pretty cold."," Nothing new here after the first 30 mins"
"35","The Zone of Interest","inspektorr","5/10","22 February 2024","On paper, this movie sounds incredible. I eagerly awaited a chance to see it, knowing fully that it will focus on the Hoess family and the fact that they lived literally right next to the biggest death factory in WW2 - Auschwitz.It saddens me to write this, but that incredible concept doesn't translate into an incredible movie. While I do understand that all of the artistic choices were deliberate, I feel like the director went too far with reductions. This is almost an anti-movie, which at some point starts looking pretentious.Everything that makes a movie a movie is stripped away - there is no music, there is almost no camera motion or camera creativity for that matter, there is no plot, no driving story, no action, no emotion. It's just a series of mundane shots of the national-socialist family living next door to a death camp.We watch the characters go about their daily business from a distance. Almost all of the shots feel like we are just standing there in a corner of a room, observing people we don't feel nothing for do totally meaningless things.Here and there there are carefully sprinkled hints of the horrors happening over the fence. Sometimes it's a smoke from a cremation chamber, other times it's the smoke from the train or a distant gunshot or someone screaming, begging for mercy.But, we learn nothing about it. This is just a distant backdrop and it has zero to do with The Zone of interest. We are forced to look the other way, just like the Hoess family chooses to do. We are forcefully complicit in ignoring the organized death happening yards away.Occasionally, the movie stops. The screen goes red. Or black. Or white. And then nothing. Some weird sounds or dissonant voices echo away for far too long and then we're back to the boring lives of Hoess family.Here and there we do see the characters actually do have an opinion, but it is never vocalized, nothing is ever discussed and the only thing we can say for sure is that their living situation, as strange and bizarre as it is, seems to be fine for them. There are some begrudging closing of windows, to stop the smoke coming in. That's it. That's the whole movie. It just ends.Being fairly familiar with Holocaust and atrocities committed by the Germans in WW2, it wasn't that hard to piece together the incredibly subtle hints of what is happening beyond the wall in terms of historical timeframe, phases of war etc. I understood what the director was trying to tell, but for me, this movie falls short. I think it would've worked better if the main characters were at least at some point forced to confront with reality beyond their garden more directly. Unfortunately, that is not what happens. Instead you're left relying on your own imagination, or more accurately on your own memory to remember other Holocaust movies."," Not what you expect and not in a good way"

"37","The Zone of Interest","nagztannouri","5/10","5 March 2024","It appears that sometimes people tend to evaluate movies primarily on the basis of the story they're built upon, rather than considering the film's inherent qualities. While recognizing the deep and profound nature of the Holocaust narrative and the contrast of human behaviors within it, it becomes essential to separate the evaluation of the movie from the pre-existing storyline.Unfortunately, the film, despite its potential, fell short in delivering a captivating and emotionally resonant experience. The gravity of the Holocaust as a theme could have been harnessed to evoke profound emotions, yet the movie failed to explore the depths it easily could have, resulting in a somewhat lackluster and emotionally detached viewing experience."," Could have been amazing..."
"38","The Zone of Interest","peter-kistemaker","5/10","26 February 2024","What have I just been watching? For me it was the most annoying, long-winded film ever on a subject where many other films, such as Schindler's List, The Pianist, The Gray Zone, managed to touch me to the depths of my soul.Okay, I understand that this film wanted to show you that the Hoss family lived a 'normal' life just outside one of the largest extermination camps ever; Auswitch.It is all clear to me that this is astonishing, incomprehensible, shocking, but you are not going to make a 100-minute film out of that, are you?What does it offer the viewer?You see people living a 'normal' life. They go on picnics, to school, play games, eat, drink, while daddy Hoss gallops to 'work' every day on his horse in good spirits to gas a few thousand people again and then burn their bodies in a crematorium.Yes, it is the pinnacle of the flattening of human emotions, but by filming that, the film becomes incredibly banal.And that banality made the story lose all its power for me. You were, as it were, watching the life of the 'Avarage' family with the burning ovens of Auswitch in the background, but the impact it was supposed to make, like those other films mentioned above did and could, was therefore, for me, completely lost. In the end I almost fell asleep because I couldn't care less about what the Hoss family was doing there and I fast-forwarded through the last half hour just to get it over with."," Boring"

In this way it was tremendously effective. Here is the problem I had however, it felt like the entire movie could have been a scene or two of a larger movie with an actual plot.

"41","The Zone of Interest","deleyshaun","5/10","24 February 2024","The zone of interest gives a snap shot of the life of a big shot camp director Hoss of Auschwitz. He lives next door with wife ( Huller) and children. The point is to show a normal, adjusted family living next to atrocity. Although it is clear what is happening it didn't come across as haunting as I thought. There were certainly enough hints of what was going on. Hoss is eventually transferred but the wife and children stay in the lush house. Huller is great as a woman who thrives in her environment and is proud to call herself the ""queen of Auschwitz"". The middle section of this film gets bogged down and some attempts at artistic scenes don't really work. I also struggled to distinguish between the children of the two families. You don't see the victims or the camp itself but do see a lot of the Nazi commanders attend meetings and socials. These scenes are done well, and shows that it's just a job to them. Also the almost final scenes depicting the camp in todays time is quite chilling. There is an abrupt ending which is satisfactory but not enthralling."," Zone of some interest."

The normal mundane life of a family living on the opposite side of a wall where unimaginable things are happening really does make you think ""how?"" numerous times as you see the backdrop of Auschwitz from the comfort bubble of the Höss' luxurious home and backgarden, but while it is a beautiful piece of film making with well-played roles from the actors, it doesn't do much after that. Apart from the obvious emotions, it did fail to draw me in and offer any life in the story. As I read from another reviewer, a short film would have been sufficient, and I agree, this didn't need to be drawn out for 1 hour and 45 minutes.I come away from this with an appreciation for the film making, a reminder of how humanity can be so inhumane, but also empty for the lack of life offered in the story."," Lifeless"

The first few scenes did make me think and where the commandant's wife has a delivery of underwear and a fur coat....it did take me a minute to comprehend that these items came from people on the camps.The constant ""hum"" of the crematoriums throughout the movie really made me think and the glow of the chimney's at night was quite gut wrenching.The scenes where the Nazis are discussing a more efficient round crematorium to kill and dispose of more Jews was so stark. They discussed this like it was normal.I think it was important, that although we could hear gun shots and screams, there were not gratuitous scenes involving the Nazis and prisoners....you just knew what was happening.I loved the ""night vision"" scenes showing the young girl leaving food for the prisoners extremely different and stark....but poignant.I found the ending a bit strange when it switched from the commandant to the current museum a bit odd but I understand the importance of having that shown.I may need to watch this a second time to get trully appeciate it."," A different point of view"

However, this strong impact didn't last long. There were shocking moments throughout the movie but overall, it was tough to watch. And when i say tough, i mean boring. Yes, this is the ""Banality of Evil"" (Hannah Arendt). But the idea was more interesting than the movie itself. You can't make a movie depending only on this. A Nazi family and their everyday problems as they are not paying attention at all to the fires and the screams next door. The directorial approach contributed to all of this. Shots were taken from far away, we don't see well their faces, we never knew who are these people. Cold and dry as it gets. And to be honest, i don't even want to know about them. I would prefer to watch them get slaughtered by the Allies.Someone might say "" It's not the movie's fault, it's your fault because it is widely known what this movie is about.

The film never shows explicit concentration camp scenes. No shootings, no living conditions. What it shows is the beautiful house and the paradise garden of family Höss, the supervisor of the camp. And you see their happy lifes and their little problems and in the background you hear shots, orders and trains arriving, carrying new ""material"".This new perspective on the holocaust is an original idea. In fact it is a new concept. Imagine don't Show instead of Show don't tell.However the film felt too long and by not escalating the situation it ends rather abrupt.

Emotional parts shot with sincirety .. but interpersonal bonding didn't responde well.. Out of eight songs Mitti And. Vande Mataram stands out. Cinematograpgy is worldclass never befor seen visuals but the editing lacks..
As per the performance Hritikh Roshan working first time with Deepika Padukone..shows some flashes of brillence.. But both did an average job .. because the story didn't ask them to excel.. Anil Kapoor with half baked role stand tall.. rest of the cast are just sitfillers... Rishabh Sawhney as the antagonist impresses ..
i watch this movie as a movie and not to dissect every minore details . And find it refreshing but just once..
And on a special note India vs one single nation narritave is now reached it's limit..
So overall it's one time watch."," Shots Fired ... But not bullseye.."

The Indian Air Force should be mighty proud of the way they and their fighter planes have been portrayed in this movie.This is no Top Gun, but the reality is any movie made anywhere in the world will always be compared to the Top Gun movies as they are the gold standard.Fighter has incredible performances by Hrithik Roshan, Anil Kapoor & Deepika Padukone. Some scenes are stellar and stay with you long after you leave the theatre.For example Hrithik's entrance and the way the song Heer Aasmani have been shot is just incredible!CGI is used in abundance, but fills in very well which was a pleasant surprise for an Indian movie.This is a difficult move to make which is why the effort of all associated with it needs to be mentioned.Do yourself a favour and watch it on the big screen with just pop corn entertainment expectations!"," Soars...despite it's flaws..."

The air force battle scenes are great and can beat Hollywood. The script is good more than Pathan and Jawan, over action movies.

Still nice for Indian movie.Weakness: Negative character is not that scary or chaotic as he could have been. Air force officer fighting with the terrorists with bare hands. Where are the special commandoes do the job? Well, that's the HERO of the movie in a BOLLYWOOD movie. Such small items just made it an average movie.Another weakness (rather very important) is Editing of the movie.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie from beginning to end, getting goosebumps during several aerial fights. The aerial combat was breathtaking, blending CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) magic with practical effects for a truly immersive experience. Watching in 3D was a bonus, especially for the terrific aerial action scenes. While the storyline may not have been groundbreaking, the film compensated with its captivating visual spectacle, with special commendation to the remarkable VFX work and the stellar performance by Hrithik Roshan.I was particularly intrigued by how the movie depicted Deepika Padukone's character parallel to Hrithik's. In many other Indian movies, the hero's character dominates the whole movie, but here, there was a good balance. It shows that when a woman wants, she can step out of her comfort zone and give her best.All the other cast members performed exceptionally well, including the main villain who promoted the militant group in Kashmir.

"76","Fighter","moonspinner55","1/10","23 March 2024","There are movies with entirely imaginative stories, where directors aim to elevate the narrative through the grandeur of the big screen.Then there are real-life stories that directors attempt to adapt for the screen, striving to do justice to the original events.And then there's Siddharth Anand, who first twists a real event into his own fantasy and then proceeds to ruin it with subpar plotting, a weak storyline, and dreadful visual effects.In attempting to emulate Top Gun, Hindi cinema not only misses the mark but completely loses the essence of the film. While Top Gun begins with a tower flyover, Hindi cinema takes it to absurd heights, with planes flying upside down over runways, thankfully without scraping the asphalt or featuring the hero lighting a cigar or busting a dance move mid-flight.The beginning of the movie is not just a poor imitation but perhaps a D-grade copy of top gun.Hrithik Roshan seems to have misjudged his role, as if starring in War wasn't enough to make him realize it's not his forte, especially when the same director and team have already produced a similar action movie. It's not just about acting in a copied Hollywood movie but also in your own.Deepika Padukone barely gets any meaningful role in the movie, apart from forced scenes, unnecessary songs, and trying to grab some screen time with Hrithik Roshan, who not only acts selfishly in the movie but seemingly in real life too.The rest of the movie is filled with the same tired tropes of portraying Pakistan forces in a negative light, along with the usual Bollywood imaginings of Pakistan, its people, and language.It's a bad movie from the very start until the end, where the Hindi cinema maverick decides to transform into Rambo.P. S.Anil Kapoor, someone forgot to tell him that it was Hritikh copying Tom Cruise and it was not his role to play."," Loser"
"77","Fighter","MeMyselfAndTheBeard","4/10","29 January 2024","First half has superb dog fight sequences but whose effects are marred by unnecessary songs, irritating characters and a villain who evokes laughter with his Tere Naam look. Hrithik is part time fighter pilot and part time planner of Balakot strikes, who has RAW level info, which he just divulges in front of top officers, probably for great appraisals.If you have seen Animal and felt that its second half was pointless, this second half is set to lower the bar even further. There is unnecessary drama and futile attempts at reviving nationalist sentiments.We were among the 12 persons in the matinee show here, at Gurgaon. I remember watching Pathaan by the same director, in a matinee show 10 days after its release and the hall was buzzing.This will stream on Netflix by Feb end.

"78","Fighter","planktonrules","3/10","29 January 2024","The movie disappoints on multiple fronts, starting with unnecessary romance shoehorned into the narrative, distracting from the supposed focus on the fighter pilot storyline. The bad acting further exacerbates the film's shortcomings, with performances that fail to convey the intensity and authenticity expected from such a genre.Plot holes abound, creating a disjointed viewing experience that leaves the audience questioning the coherence of the storyline. The movie leans heavily on clichés, offering nothing fresh or original, making it feel like a recycled and uninspired attempt within the Indo-Pak war genre.Pilots consistently disobeying their commanding officer throughout the film not only strains believability but also undermines the credibility of the characters. Lastly, some of the film's scenes blatantly resemble to Top Gun comes across as a cheap imitation, ultimately leaving viewers longing for the authenticity and originality found in the iconic predecessor."," Bad direction, plot and acting is a combo I wasn't expecting"
"79","Fighter","Peach-2","4/10","21 March 2024","A Top Gun wannabe where Hritik slaps on way too much style and attitude, it looked like he was hamming it rather than acting. Bollywood movie makers still employ the old tactics of surrounding a bunch of sycophants around the hero, whose sole job is to constantly edify the hero and raise him on a pedestal. Hollywood phased it out in the 90s and early 2000, yet Bollywood persist to massage the hero's ego, instead of providing the audience with a realistic hero as shown in Uri. Anil Kapoor was decent with his down to earth attitude. The ubiquitous Deepika is found again in another mindless action flick reprising a similar type of role. Besides the action sequence there wasn't much to like about the movie, much less the story or acting."," Souless action flick !!"
"80","Fighter","seeingbystarlight","5/10","27 January 2024","Fighter helmed by Sidharth Anand and featuring a stellar cast including Hrithik Roshan, Deepika Padukone, and Anil Kapoor, unfortunately, falls into a myriad of pitfalls that collectively diminish the film's overall impact. The most glaring issue is the excessive use of slow-motion shots, which not only overwhelms the viewer but also detracts from the storytelling. The repetitive nature of these sequences becomes a veritable headache, diluting the potential impact of pivotal moments.While the star power of the cast is undeniable, the film's visual effects leave much to be desired. The CGI elements lack the finesse expected in contemporary cinema, diminishing the overall cinematic experience. Furthermore, the inclusion of songs seems more like a gratuitous platform for Deepika Padukone's dance performances rather than serving a purpose within the narrative, contributing to a disjointed viewing experience.The inclusion of songs in the movie felt forced and unnecessary. While music can undoubtedly elevate a film, in ""Fighter,"" it appeared more like a platform for Deepika Padukone to showcase her dance skills than an integral part of the storytelling. This diversion from the plot not only disrupted the flow but also left me questioning the purpose of these musical interludes.A notable drawback is the film's length, and this issue could have been mitigated by a judicious removal of the superfluous slow-motion shots. Trimming the runtime would not only enhance the pacing but also potentially salvage the film's narrative cohesion.The dog-fight scenes, crucial in a film of this genre, disappoint with their lackluster execution. The fighter plane's appearance verges on the cartoonish, compromising the realism necessary for such intense sequences. This, unfortunately, positions ""Fighter"" as a pale imitation rather than a worthy contender in the action-thriller genre.**Military Maneuvers by Hollywood, Not the IAF:** The movie throws around military ranks and procedures like confetti at a party. Group leaders can't just transfer squadron leaders, and ""borrowing"" a fighter jet is pure fantasy. Come on, guys, some basic research goes a long way.**Action Sequences That Defied Physics:** The action scenes were more like action *comedy*. Pilots teleporting after ejection and mid-air fistfights? I get it, Hollywood loves explosions, but some semblance of realism would have been nice. This wasn't ""Top Gun,"" it was ""Top goof.""**Radio Silence...Except It Wasn't?:** They tried to create tension with a jamming scene, but any real pilot knows fighter jets have ways to counter that. It felt like the writers forgot about basic military tech in their quest for drama.**War Crimes for Entertainment? No Thanks:** Adding insult to injury, the movie depicts a war crime that was just plain insensitive. Using such a serious topic as a plot point was a massive low blow.**Showcasing Indian Power...Except They Didn't? ** India has some impressive military tech, like the BrahMos missile. This movie could have been a chance to showcase that, but instead, it was a complete no-show. Talk about a missed opportunity!**Overall, ""Fighter"" felt like a flashy brochure for fighter jets written by someone who wouldn't know a wingman from a wing nut.** It wasn't entertaining, and it wasn't even a good kind of unrealistic. If you're looking for a movie that respects the Indian Air Force and delivers thrilling aerial combat, this one's a total dud. Stick to documentaries, people.Comparisons with Ajay Devgn's ""Runway 34"" further amplify the film's shortcomings. Despite a potentially smaller budget, ""Runway 34"" managed to deliver a more engaging and commendable cinematic experience. The discrepancy raises questions about the directorial choices made in ""Fighter,"" leaving audiences longing for a more polished and well-thought-out production.In conclusion, ""Fighter"" struggles to soar to the heights anticipated from a film of this caliber. Sidharth Anand's vision, marred by a lack of restraint in certain aspects, results in a movie that feels like a missed opportunity rather than the cinematic triumph it could have been."," Fighter doesn't soar, it sinks mid-flight"

It is hopefully fairly easy for everyone to guess what happens next in pretty much every scene.It's like you've heard these 20 songs for a long time and someone released a new song with rhythms borrowed from all of them together to fit into one song with a normal average length. Is the problem that it borrows ideas from multiple narrations or is it the fact that each one of those narrations itself is mainstream meaning it would be borrowed already?"," Ridiculously average"

The best part of the movie is that it takes place in Ireland as there are some nice scenic views that happen to be refreshing but other than that, most of the film seemed outdated. The script was weak and lacked depth, and there wasn't much emotion between the characters that of which made the movie more unbearable to watch. It seems as though the director tried to make Lindsay Lohan stand out, but honestly it did nothing to really showcase her acting abilities and did give much of the people to looo forward towards her career.The film was overall, boring and slow. I would not recommend this film unless you are watching it with a child, and even then I wouldn't really recommend it because of how stupid it is.The best person in the film was the fairy because she caused a turning point in the film that of which caused a tad bit more of suspense, but after the ""wish has been granted"" the movie went back to being slow and weak.

The music played in the pub for real would probably have been a lot better than the Hollywood orchestrated version replacing it. Bah, Humbug! (And that's not an Irish expression). I seriously don't know why they bothered making this film, although the landscape shots were nice (the only reason I gave it two stars and not one) and it might bring a few more people to Ireland to spend a few bob and boost the tourist industry.

"115","Irish Wish","parrishken","3/10","3 April 2024","I'm a big fan of so-bad-they're-good chickflicks, but this was just a very rough watch. This movie sets a ""you may not need what you think you need"" story against the backdrop of a gorgeous Irish landscape, which to be fair is a pretty good premise. However, the movie drops the ball pretty much immediately and is a slog to watch.For starters, the acting is very stilted and dialogue feels weird and unnatural. The only one who exudes any charisma at all is Ed Speleers, but even he struggles to make the script sound like sentences actual people would say.Story-wise, the movie is especially strange. There seem to be a bunch of storylines that kind of come out of the blue and, in particular, set-ups that go nowhere and ""pay-offs"" that have never seemed to be set-up.To give a small example from the very beginning of the movie: The main characters mother is the principal of a highschool and, during a phone conversation, makes a big deal out of her keyboard not working properly when trying to order toilet paper. You'd think this sets up some sort of joke about a ton of toilet paper accidentally being ordered, but no. This was the ""joke"". The key of her keyboard was stuck.Another example is at a rehearsal diner, where family decides to quiz the happy couple. The question for the main character is where their proposal was, which WE as an audience know she doesn't know because of the wish, but literally who shows up to a wedding with a quiz that contains this question? How is this something actual humans would ask in that setting?A particularly weird twist is at the very end, where it's revealed that the main character didn't just edit, but secretly wrote the book of her famous author fiancé. Why? This isn't set up at all and it's completely unnecessary for the ""lesson"" she's supposed to learn. Just have her decide she doesn't want to be an editor anymore and wants to go write her own book. Like, why make this story any more complicated?Finally, Ireland is presented as some sort of cartoonish hamlet where everyone knows everyone and locals spend their weekdays drinking Guinness and dancing a jig to live music in the local pub as it storms outside, which I'm sure offends some Irish person somewhere. Even though it's established that the main love interest has spent years travelling abroad, people in Ireland recognize him and lend him their car because ""he used to come here for holidays when he was a kid"", which is just hilariously stupid.All in all, this feels like it was written by AI, acted by robots and shouldn't even be watched ironically."," Very rough watch"

From the outset to its conclusion, the narrative beats are predictable, leaving little room for unexpected twists or turns.Set against the backdrop of the Irish countryside, the film attempts to infuse the familiar wish-fulfillment fantasy with the charm of its location. However, even the picturesque scenery fails to breathe new life into the worn-out plot.The main characters, while adequately placed within the narrative structure, lack depth and fail to distinguish themselves from the countless other rom-com archetypes. Their interactions feel rehearsed, and their development follows a formulaic trajectory that offers little in the way of genuine emotional engagement.Visually, the film captures the beauty of Ireland, with sweeping landscapes and quaint villages serving as a picturesque backdrop for the unfolding romance. However, these aesthetic flourishes are unable to compensate for the film's lackluster script and uninspired storytelling.Ultimately, ""An Irish Wish"" is a forgettable addition to the rom-com genre, offering little more than a rehash of tired tropes and predictable plot points.

Everything else was just bad.The Many Cons: Did AI write the script because it was just so stale. The clothes and hair were bad. I seriously think I saw some of those dresses at Walmart. The plot was just too predictable and slow. We know to suspend disbelief on movies like this. But this was just painful to watch. I only finished it because I had already invested an hour of my precious time and I wanted to see it through. Did they really expect us to believe that you would just go on as normal with a wedding if your mom didnt show up and you didnt know what happened to her? Please...Ayesha Curry was just terrible. If you see Lindsay Lohan promoting a film with Ayesha as your co-star, you know its going to be bad. Ayesha has never acted as a movie lead before and it was just tedious to watch. The whole movie, she has one expression on her face - eyes bulging and mouth open. I am convinced that she is throwing spaghetti at the wall, trying to find something that sticks because her cookware lines, restaurants, tv shows, skin care line, and current celebrity business trend that she is doing are all a failure. But since she and linsday are besties, this explains why she was cast.Lindsay's brother, Dakota, was in the movie and it was his first role and it showed. Just wooden and forced. I am a big Lindsay fan but this is not the comeback we wanted. But I hear that she is doing a new Freaky Friday movie which makes sense. Because after doing this movie, she has to redeem herself by doing something tried and true.I wanted to love this so badly. If you watch it, do something else while you are watching it so it wont be a total waste of your time. If not, you wont be able to get those 90 minutes back!"," Just bad"

I still really enjoyed it a lot since I love seeing Lohan make a comeback after drugs - she's not the greatest actress in the world but I think she's charming and funny and I enjoy her in the rom coms. I also love Ireland very much so the production was very kitschy and beautiful, the way Ireland beauty is! Don't watch it if you're expecting a life-changing film but do if you're in the mood for a cute and light hearted popcorn muncher!

It was as if they made it to release the movie and get rid of it. The actors and actresses did not act very well and could not make us feel that feeling. In my opinion, anyone can watch it, this is my review, but there are many people who think the same as me. As for another issue, almost nothing happens in the first 35 minutes of the movie and this demoralized me while watching it.35 minutes felt like 3 hours for me and after a while I was busy with my phone, I almost didn't watch the movie, in one word, it's a disgrace."," A boring movie adventure"

Every cliche is there. The guys do nothing, they're just window dressing. Lindsay was left to carry this. Sadly it's just a bomb. Her awkward cuteness that she brought to her earlier rolls doesn't fly here. It's almost like they were trying to make a parody of bad rom coms. It's so bad I couldn't look away.

I'm not sure if the folks who gave this under 5 stars simply have it out for Lindsay Lohan or were expecting something other than what the film wanted to be - a feel-good rom-com suited for all ages.I know Ms. Lohan has gone through some difficult times, but I don't know that her acting was ever the problem, and I think her acting is quite good here. I found her character very appealing, as were all the characters really (well, maybe except for the author's mother, but the actress played that role well). I found the acting to be just fine across the board, and while the film wasn't a gut-buster, there were a few moments that made me laugh out loud. And the film was far less 'sappy' than many of its genre. Obviously the storyline wasn't realistic, but it also obviously wasn't supposed to be.I've been to Ireland and the cinematography has me wanting to return.If you're in the mood for something lite with attractive scenery and music as well as a decent storyline and performances (even if we all know what's coming), I think this will fit the bill nicely."," Not sure what the detractors wanted"
"127","Irish Wish","LukeCustomer2","3/10","17 March 2024","I so wanted to like this but it was plagued by the same thing a lot of the cheaper rom coms tend to have... a robot way of dialog. I do think this script was IA inspired because everything is so flat and plain and 90% of the story is told by exposition, dialog with the main character on the phone to her mom. ""Mom you know I have always been in love with X"" , Mom says ""sweety you know I told you to tell him your feelings"". This movie is tell don't show.The big problem though is there isn't really a ton of chemistry with either of the male actors and Lohan. The guy she is crushing on isn't that great and you can't really see why she is crushing on him. The guy she ends up with they employ the ""haters to lovers"" trope and do it poorly because there is no reason for them to be fighting. They also use the trope of two people in a room together will fall in love for no other reason than they are together. Also problematic is the music. Poor rom coms tend to have this... music that is plain and doesn't seem to match what is going on tends to hurt the overall story - you feel like the whole thing is trying too hard."," Ooof this was bad."

The story follows a book editor named Maddie Kelly(Lohan) who is in love with her publisher Paul Kennedy(Vladros). Things take a turn however when Paul falls for Maddie's best friend Emma(Tan)and he decides to marry her in Ireland.Heartbroken Maddie makes a wish on a magic stone with a mysterious Irish lady and she wakes up the next day with Paul who she ends up being the bride. Things couldn't be great for Maddie,until she meets a handsome photographer named James(Speelers) and romance starts blossoming between the two.Now she has to decide who she wants to be with the sly Paul or the friendly James?.Going into this film I knew what was going to happen but if your a Lindsay Lohan fan then you'll love it. The film itself reminded me of 27 Dresses(girl falls for boss who winds up getting engaged to her sister) meets Leap Year(both are set in Ireland and the girl falls for a guy that's not her bethroed).Overall I enjoyed it."," A predictable romantic comedy set with a gorgeous scenary"
"129","Irish Wish","meemsyd","5/10","15 March 2024","It's nice to see Lindsay Lohan again, but this movie is not her best work, nor Ed Speeler's. It's mildly enjoyable if you feel like watching a mindless tropey romance, predictable and familiar. There's a love triangle, an element of magic, wedding weekend, meet-cute, caught in a rainstorm etc, so you really feel the similarities to other good romcoms from the 90s & 00s, but it definitely feels like cheaper quality.Good parts of the film were the scenery, and that the story moved at a good pace since the movie is a standard 1h 30m. Weaknesses were in the cliche unrealistic dialogue (especially with side characters) and the lack of creativity in the story and execution.

"130","Irish Wish","destiny_west","5/10","16 March 2024","I am not going to be over-critical with my review. This movie isn't meant to be anything more than what it is, just a romantic comedy with beautiful scenery. If you are expecting more than that, I suggest you don't bother. The storyline is quaint and predictable. But it was an okay way to spend an hour and a half, even if you were just envious of the backdrop during that time. It is good to see Lindsay Lohan in this rom/com. She is good in the role of her character who can't quite speak up for herself and quite frankly is a bit of a doormat when it comes to her crush Paul Kennedy. But as they say, the grass isn't greener on the other side, it just appears that way.

Ayesha Curry was a standout.Do not expect this film to be an intellectual exercise or to be particularly unique and don't whine when it isn't as this is a story with familiar fairy-tale tropes and that quintessential HEA.

A little fantasy was involved, but done very gracefully...not too much. Though the male actors weren't Irish actors, they were very appealing, especially the photographer. It's nice to sit down and just enjoy a nice rom com without swearing or nudity or crassness. It's just a sweet romantic movie about a woman who thinks she knows who she wants as a mate.

There's good chemistry between James and Maddie and the awkwardness between Maddie and Paul is great as well.

"134","Irish Wish","pixfan","4/10","18 March 2024","Lindsay Lohan is a very talented actress! I love her & don't understand why she chose this movie. Here are some of the things that didn't work in the movie and what she should consider when choosing her next project:
1. Horrible costume design - really hideous outdated wardrobe for all the women especially. Those bridesmaid dresses were ill-fitting and you could see all the undergarment lines, etc. - just unprofessional costuming.2. The script was dull with unimaginative dialogue and plot lines that just did not work at all. There was no time & development to build up the relationships to make any of them believable.3. The hairstyles were frumpy & outdated - from another era - especially Lindsay's never ending hair length that was styled like an elementary school-aged girl.5. The makeup on her friends looks like it was painted on like a mask and they looked like their faces were pumped up with Botox, lip filler -etc. They looked very unauthentic as real women in their late 20's to early 30's. These Hallmark-type movies have to stop either hiring or encouraging women 30-40 years old to do this to their face. These women look freakish, unreal and look clownish as if playing caricatures of themselves.6. Weird casting with the groom's mother looking a few decades younger than her husband and having her dressed in pearls, matronly clothes and her Irish accent didn't sound Irish. Please stop giving women actresses over 40 ugly hairstyles from the 1950's - it looks stupid & it's not representative of how women 40-60 REALLY look! When will these movies stop these dumb stereotypes in casting/makeup/casting/script, etc?The scenes of Ireland were beautiful and music was nice, though way over the top dramatic for certain scenes. With Brad Krevoy & other veterans of these types of movies on board, the movie should have been much better.Lindsay - you're great!

I was honestly engaged enough to see how Maddie's wish turned back around into the actual situation. And even though I knew how it would turn out, I was still happy at the end.

The locations were beautiful and definitely made me add Ireland to my travel list.I have always loved Lindsay as an actress- I grew up when people like her and Hilary Duff were everywhere and I loved them both (no matter how cheesy or predictable their ventures/shows/films were). She could be in a show eating cheese (something that I'm allergic too) and I'd probably still find her project charming cause she's good at what she does. Happy this made number 1 on Netflix. Watched it the first day it came out in the UK. Bring on more Lindsay projects.Lindsay is definitely the standout in this cast, as well as her true love interest. I have no problem with a romcom being predictable, and really not sure why it's such a problem for people. I want romcoms to be feel-good and predictable because life is complicated enough. Romcoms for me are like these warm hugs, cups of soup, blankets for can snuggle under. Indeed, for most romcoms you can predict the outcome in the trailer- that was the same with Bridget Jones and other great romcoms and it's the same thing with this. There are fun twists and turns in this film of course and it's fun to see how they get to the predictable conclusion, and on some level the Irish Wish reminded me a little of 13 going on 30 (another great romcom). I enjoyed the cast - they all did great jobs in their role and I left the film with a smile on my face.

It's undemanding entertainment, perfect if you're a lover of the genre and if you want something all the generations in your family can enjoy - particularly if you're in the mood for a gentle romantic movie with an engaging cast, and pretty scenery and fashion. It's one of those movies you can have on again and again, and enjoy its charm, like a warm bowl of comfort food.

If you don't like LL or her face, why are you still so obsessed with her that you take the time to watch the movie and leave a mean girl review? You don't even go here.Back to the movie, it's your typical Netflix romance! It gave a castle for Christmas vibes (but in Ireland). I couldn't stop gaping at the scenery or at the main two actors.

Lindsay Lohan's character (she is very believable as a woman with some hidden Irish connection), eventually finds a love that is not what she expected, assisted by an old Irish saint (a witch by another word).

If you love Lifetime movies, you'll likely enjoy 'Irish Wish,' but if not, it's a definite skip. The writing feels cheesy and elementary, lacking the depth.It seems as if scenes were barely rehearsed, giving off the impression that the first take was often the final take, leading to performances that feel unpolished and sometimes awkward.The plot, while aiming for heartwarming, often veers into predictability, failing to offer any real surprises or moments of genuine emotion. The characters are broadly drawn, lacking complexity, making it difficult to truly invest in their journeys.Despite these criticisms, 'Irish Wish' may find its audience among those looking for light, uncomplicated entertainment. It's the kind of movie that doesn't demand much from its viewers, making it a perfect fit for a lazy afternoon when you're looking to switch off your brain and indulge in some predictable romance.

Repeating every single story that has been done as 100x over and presenting it as something new and exciting? What a total drab of a movie. The only character that was somewhat interesting was the actual Irish fairy, especially when she disappeared into oblivion. Okay, some of the nature shots were okay, but that, well..., is nature for you. Honestly, why this bombardment of elite extravagance thrown into the face of the audience? Is it really necessary to show all that wealth obtained by force, slavery, extortion and corruption? Guess the message was clear, the elite making their fame and money over the backs of honest people, at least that seemed to be correct. And please, stop using all these Botox actors and actresses, just use real people, not the fake blown up Barbie dolls, sick and tired of that nonsense. Anyways, a movie that has been done a 100x before, so based on that, a complete waste of good resources. It's time for something new!"," An annoying show of Botox and elite extravagance"
"146","Irish Wish","Bobalopacus","4/10","24 March 2024","I should state that I am not the target audience for this movie, but I am not averse to the occasional well made rom-com.This isn't either well-made or funny or particularly romantic, but it has a tepid charm to it if you're willing to set your expectations extremely low and may appeal to a younger audience. It certainly has little to say to adults, being essentially a preteen girls fantasy, yet not really appropriate for that audience either.However, if you're looking for something undemanding with some pretty scenery it might pass the time.I haven't seen Lindsay Lohan in anything since 2005's Herbie movie and I barely recognised her. It is well known that actresses in their late-thirties to fifties struggle to find decent leading roles, however Lohan isn't doing herself any favours by being cast in a role she seems too old for. Certainly people in their late thirties can struggle to find a suitable partner, but most of them have lived a little by that point.Lohan's character, Maddie Kelly, is an unassertive editorial assistant who falls for a famous writer she works for and has just gathered the courage to declare her feelings to him when he falls for someone else.It is never made clear what Maddie has being doing with her life up to this point.She doesn't appear to have had any previous relationships, lacks the confidence to pursue her ambitions, is totally incapable of recognising that the object of her affection is a shallow, narcissistic, domineering a***hole and doesn't appear to have any friends of any substance. Despite all this, she seems perfectly content.When confronted with a semi-nude man who she apparently has the hots for, she recoils as if having never been in that position before.She still relys on her mother for advice and is easily pushed into situations she is uncomfortable with.All this might be believable if she was in her late teens/early twenties and this was a coming-of-age tale, but without a backstory to account for her situation it just seems odd at nearly forty to be acting like this.To add to this incrogruity, we are told Maddie is a talented author, but the only indication that she writes is a single scene in which she sits at a computer and we read on the screen 'Untitled Novel, Chapter One..' and then a blank screen as if she is struggling to come up with something...'Once upon a time' perhaps?Similarly, when asked who her favourite author is she claims 'James Joyce', which makes you wonder why she is helping to write trashy romance novels and not astoundingly inventive and complex literary masterpieces - it is almost as if the screenwriters simply googled 'famous Irish author' and thought 'never heard of him but he'll do'.It is at moments like these that Irish Wish is unintentionally amusing.Putting that aside, Lohan does have screen presence so it's a shame that her character is poorly written, the dialogue so lacking in spark or wit and the plot entirely predictable and generic.The introduction, fairly early on, of a low-fantasy element does allow the set designers to almost get away with some very corny scenes of Ireland with fake looking environments and almost insulting cliches about the irish, but the magical is merely a plot device here and is never played out to it's full potential.The supporting cast do little to help matters. Whilst there is some miniscule chemistry between Maddie and James, played by Ed Speelers, they hardly set the screen alight and are let down again by weak dialogue. Meanwhile, the predictable spat between two of the main characters lacks either humour or believable motive.Every now and then Maddie randomly trips over - maybe this was where the laughs were meant to be inserted?Jane Seymour pops up as Maddie's mother, but is curiously underwritten and never appears on screen with Lohan suggesting her inclusion might have been a last minute one. Paul Kennedy plays the author mentioned above, but his character is too thinly sketched to be anything other than a prop for plot development, whilst Ayesha Curry has no discernible character at all - merely serving to add occasional exposition (and more cynically, perhaps, diversity).I could tell, two minutes in, that Irish Wish wasn't going to be up to much, but saw it through to the end, so you don't have to.Irish Wish shares a lot in common with Bridget Jones' Diary ( very mild spoiler alert: clumsy woman seeking career recognition falls for inappropriate domineering boss and is fought over by two men) but makes that film look like a cinematic masterpiece."," As corny, predictable and kitsch as a leprechaun in a Dublin gift shop"

But the movie was shot in Ireland so the scenery is breathtaking and the film still manages to be mildly entertaining if you can't find something better.

Couldn't they at least have matched wardrobe colours to complement each character? What a hodge podge of horrible clothing that doesn't even resemble contemporary styles. The characters seemed to dress well in the states and all of this fell to pieces once they headed to Ireland. Seriously does the director really believe this is how people dress in Ireland?

SPOILERS when the old lady dies its way more funny than scary. A few jumpscares at the end. It also is a little confusing. Its also kind of boring. Its more of a drama reality tv show, rather than a thriller film. Jessica (the main character) tries to be the hero and it gets really annoying. The Teenager is also very very annoying and outrageous and didn't really need to be in the plot. Overall, i wouldnt waste your time. Its very boring, overrated, comedic, and just a waste of time.

As it turns out, ""Imaginary"" wasn't as easy to figure out, even if the ending was somewhat predictable.We live in a world where scary movies seldom ""scare"", and this movie's strength isn't in its ability to scare you but fill you with a deep uneasiness from one scene to the next. This slow-burn style of filmmaking that relies on suspense and the occasional unexpected jump scare is, to me at least, more palpable and effective than outright gore fests like SAW or Evil Dead.Not the scariest movie I've ever seen, but I'll never turn my back to teddy bears ever again. 7/10."," Not terrifying, but definitely unsettling."

It is a film that keeps you in suspense, it has elements of a fantasy film, two plot twists that leave you speechless, emotional moments, it transports you to another world for two hours. I could liken it to a children's horror story where the nanny is the evil witch disguised as the good fairy, the evil animal, the little child who gets into trouble, the savior parent and Fantasyland, where everything is possible.

Imaginary is a horror film from Blumhouse which has several interesting story ideas but ultimately squanders in execution in several ways. While the first hour or so is fairly decent, albeit leaning towards a more Insidious-adjacent approach to horror laden with blatent jumpscares and some modest attempts at eerieness, the latter half of the film loses it's grip on the tight setting that the first half possessed.Several aspects and concepts, such as the antagonistic imaginary friend Chauncey possessing the same voice as the young girl, Alice, are intrigueing and if done right could have been sufficiently creepy, the acting choice to have the young actress but on an impressionistic ""creepy voice"" fails in making an actually scary and comes off as almost comedic at times."," Tolerable PG-13 horror slop"

Alas, this ""Imaginary"" is as generic and predictable as they come: the little kid in a home with some complicated family-dynamics, the house with a creepy history, the cute doll (here a teddybear) that we at times (oh horror!!) see turn his head and that more and more gets a supernatural hold on the kid, and a climactic finale in which the evil finally shows its true terrifying shape. It's all there.Well, even predictability doesn't have to be bad, if it's well done, with some decent special effects and a solid story. But unfortunately all this was not the case here. The story is shaky and unnecessary complicated, and direction and editing are disappointing: the whole movie is way too talkative and explanatory (especially from the moment the old neighbor lady steps in), and for a supposed horror movie it's way too low on serious scares. Teddybear Chauncey is definitely no Chucky or Annabelle, until the final showdown he doesn't cause any deaths or destruction, even the obnoxious boyfriend (in most horror movies a number one candidate for a gruesome killing) got away in one piece. There's an inventive plot-twist halfway in time, and the supernatural Escher-like labyrinth, in which the family in the end gets trapped to fight the evil, is well done, but that couldn't save the movie.

The beginning meanders along slowly but in this time doesnt really accomplish much. The characters aren't developed and instead look like they're just warming up for their first acting gig.Some of the attempted scary scenes feel like family channel kids horror with the combination of poor acting and low scare factor. The actor that plays the dad goes on a trip midway through the movie almost signaling like the director had witnessed enough, but didn't want to not use the footage they'd already filmed, so sent him on some music trip.Once the action takes places an incredible amount of weird random dialogue takes place. The older neighbor of theirs really doesn't serve much purpose despite their efforts to make her relevant. In fact the movie could have been done with just the mother and youngest daughter and that way maybe they could have developed them more.The ending scenes in the other world I suppose are fine, but even with them they manage to throw in some weird cringey clichés. By this point the ship had sunken and in some ways thought it might have been at least comical if the bear got at least one of them.It seemed by the end nobody in the theatre was taking it too seriously.

"181","Imaginary","jboothmillard","3/10","16 March 2024","Blumhouse Productions (Insidious, Sinister, Get Out, M3GAN) have had many great hits, but in recent years they have made less successful films, including Halloween Ends, Insidious: The Red Door, The Exorcist: Believer, Five Nights at Freddy's, and Night Swim, I was hoping that this latest offering from them could be good, directed by Jeff Wadlow (Cry Wolf, Kick-Ass 2, Blumhouse's Fantasy Island). Basically, children's author and illustrator Jessica (DeWanda Wise) is married to British musician Max (Tom Payne), who has two daughters, young Alice (Pyper Braun) and teenager Taylor (Taegen Burns), from his previous marriage. Alice likes Jessica but Taylor is somewhat distant towards her new stepmother. Jessica is haunted by nightmares which include her father Ben (Samuel Salary) and her fictional character, Simon the Spider. The family has moved into Jessica's childhood home. Exploring the basement, Alice discovers a teddy bear. Alice tells Jessica the bear's name is Chauncey and quickly forms a bond with him. Jessica is reunited with the elderly neighbour Gloria (Betty Buckley), who used to babysit her as a child. Gloria shares memories of Jessica's childhood, which she cannot remember. Alice's and Taylor's mentally unstable biological mother Samantha (Alix Angelis) breaks into the house to see her daughters. The police arrive and take Samantha away after she tries to attack Jessica; Taylor confesses to contacting her. Jessica puts Alice to bed, remarking to her that she used to have a friend (imaginary) like Chauncey. Jessica is left to look after the children when Max embarks on a tour with his band. Alice becomes fixated on completing a scavenger hunt list, apparently compiled by Chauncey. Jessica becomes slowly disturbed by the teddy bear's overwhelming presence in Alice's life. One day, Jessica goes to visit Ben, who is living in an institution due to a mental breakdown. While she is gone, Taylor invites young neighbour Liam (Matthew Sato) over. During his visit, Liam offers her what appears to be drugs which she does not take, and he knocks over and shatters an alcohol bottle. Liam goes to the bathroom to find a towel and use the toilet, during which he is toyed with by Chauncey, including with his pull string, Liam assumes he is tripping. Then Chauncey briefly turns into a monstrous bear and frightens Liam. Jessica returns and catches him and Taylor, angering her stepdaughter. Afterward, one of the instructions on Alice's list is ""something that hurts""; Jessica narrowly stops Alice from slamming her hand down onto a nail. Jessica calls therapist and child psychologist Dr. Soto (Veronica Falcón) to come speak to Alice. Soto observes Alice talk to Chauncey and speak on his behalf, who makes threatening remarks about Jessica. Alice cries about their friendship falling apart, and Soto notices when she turns her head, that Alice is not speaking as the teddy bear. Jessica talks about Alice and the bear spending time together, but Soto makes her realise that only she and Alice can see the bear. Soto shows Jessica footage of a past child patient (Eduardo Campirano), and the little boy uses a phrase Alice used: ""Never Ever"". Alice disappears after speaking to Chauncey again and Taylor blames her stepmother for her sister's disappearance. Taylor encounters Gloria who invites her to her home and explains what happened to Jessica as a child. Chauncey was also Jessica's childhood imaginary friend. Gloria explains that imaginary friends are spirits that bind themselves to the young and may become aggressive if abandoned; Jessica abandoned Chauncey and he is angered. Jessica goes through her childhood belongings and finds drawing a door that she drew with the words ""Never Ever"". Taylor and Gloria return to complete the scavenger hunt list for themselves while in the basement, hoping it will lead them to Alice. The final step is to do ""something that hurts"", Jessica stabs herself in the hand, but it does not work. Jessica then suddenly says hateful things towards Taylor, and this causes a glowing door to appear in the basement; Jessica explains that it was saying awful things that were ""hurtful"". Jessica, Taylor and Gloria enter the realm of Never Ever, a place controlled by imagination. They find a door showing Jessica's childhood incident. Chauncey had lured Jessica into the Never Ever. A flashback reveals that Ben rescued her, going mad in the process from seeing Chauncey's eyes. Jessica left home shortly after to live with her paternal grandmother. Gloria, who has grown obsessed with the realm, goes mad and deliberately closes the escape route. Moments later, a door opens beside Gloria and the monstrous Chauncey mauls her to death. Jessica and Taylor locate Alice, after going through a series of rooms and they attempt to escape. Chauncey goes berserk as the group leaves, but Jessica stops him by stabbing him in the eye. After reuniting with Ben and Max at the institution, Jessica realises she is still stuck in the imaginary world. Chauncey has used Alice as bait to lure Jessica, his real target, as he seeks revenge for her abandoning him. Taylor arrives and saves Jessica. Chauncey turns to his true form, Jessica's literary Simon, a giant vicious spider. The creature tries to turn Jessica insane hypnotising her with his eyes, but Alice sets the creature on fire. The spider is sealed behind the door and the entrance to the realm is painted over with black paint. The family escapes as the basement is ignited, and they get out before the fire spreads through the house, and it burns to the ground. The family almost checks into a hotel but they are frightened by a child playing with his imaginary friend who is another teddy bear. The three leave for the next hotel. Also starring Wanetah Walmsley as Barbara, Rhythm Hurd as Young Jessica, Shawn Sanz as Officer, Lawrence J. Weber Jr. As Orderly, and Dane DiLiegro as Chauncey Beast. The story involving dormant memories reawakened with an evil presence is silly, the teddy bear is not creepy enough to take seriously, and the predictable dialogue is laughably daft. Any attempts to create twists and turns or to make it scary are wasted, and the moment the characters enter the imaginary world it is just non-sensical, it gets so ridiculous that I just wanted it to end, a most disappointing and mediocre supernatural horror. Adequate!"," Imaginary"
"182","Imaginary","rgkarim","5/10","9 March 2024","LIKES:Decent Pace
-Imaginary is a movie that keeps consistent in keeping the story moving with minimum divergence to complicate matters.-Approximately ten minutes in, the mischief and intrigue start, doing their best to keep things engaging for the two hours.A faster pacing allowed the movie to feel less sluggish, which made it more enjoyable for me.Okay Acting
-The movie is a far cry from the best acting category, but that does not mean it's the worst performance group in the industry.I enjoyed Pyper Braun's acting merits to many levels as she captured a girl caught between traumatic sessions and finding a means to cope. Her voice work holds borderline creepy elements, and she displays terror and hurt to a believable level that helps capture that sincerity.-Burns' acting is a step up from her Mighty Ducks days, going from pre-tween diva to moody teenager. Stumbling a bit in her transitions, she manages to pull some better acting skills in the final act that is promising for future roles once she masters it.-Yet, DeWanda Wise is the best actress in this movie for me, displaying touching moments of connection and balanced emotion that provided a better character.-She may have gotten a bit overdramatic at times, and there were some ill-presented lines, but they were (mostly) kept in check for this movie despite the corny writing
Funny
-Whether intentional or not, the movie ends up having very humorous moments that left me chuckling or laughing at loud.-Chauncey's games and taunts are very childlike, but then receive an adult twist that spices things up and adds extra laugh power.-Or perhaps you'll just find the looks of the monsters to be laughable as well, many of them a parody that reflects what imagination can craft when at a young age.-If that's not enough, then there are always the toned-down lines, forced emotion, and overacted character qualities that may get a rise out of you.Creative Starts To Creepiness:
-Horror movies thrive on a lot of presentation styles to create that lasting feeling of terror.-Imaginary takes some of the playbook tricks and manages to nudge them to an original setup that shows promise for a memorable bout of terror.-When you have an imaginary friend, the sky is the limit for ways to open up putting our ""heroes"" in peril, and there were times I was impressed with the start of the scare and how creative they got.Heartfelt Moments:
-Like many movies in this genre, Imaginary's characters have to address some things in their past to recover and thrive in the future.-Two character arcs in particular had moments that I resonated with, fantastic presentations of the trauma, combined with authentic portrayals of the hurt they can bring.-One moment was fantastic for me, as they used the scene in many ways that helped maximize the impact of that story for me. Its design answered a few gaping questions while also helping forge a stronger bond between two characters that struck me deeply.-Moments like these are the best part of the movie given the purpose it brings to the film alongside crafting characters to invest my time into watching.DISLIKESOverdramatic Plot:
-The movie tries to give more to the story than other horror films though, something I appreciate very much in a very expansive genre.-This story does have elements that work well with the drama and horror elements and help enrich the characters past the usual fodder status that is seen.-However, the movie tends to waver to the more CW-esque drama patterns, becoming more about over-expression than an engaging plot.-When the predictability component factors in, the plot only weakened further for me, which inflated the dramatic flair for me.Too Silly For Its Own Good
-Granting a PG-13 rating is a double-edged sword for a movie in my experience.-For Imaginary, I think the rating dulled the film, allowing for too much silliness that got in the way of the horror elements.-Between the comical displays of the bad guys and ludicrous secondary characters, there were too many interruptions that diluted what I came to the movie to see.-Dialog and acting further added to the silliness and resulted in dulling the movie down to a censored version of a concept that could have gone much further.-Factor in the overdramatic limitation, Imagination then starts to move into an area where the cuteness becomes a bit distracting and annoying. This feeling seems to be a big part of what has lowered the ratings and perhaps might be too much comedy for its good.Too Many Plot Elements
-A minor dislike of this movie, Imaginary tries to take on a lot of things in a short amount of time.-I think it handled it, okay. Some elements accomplished the goal of diving into the psyche of the main character and connecting these broken pieces to make a fulfilling character arc.-However, another plot felt half-baked, the little girl's story holding some details that were intriguing, but were utilized as plot devices to bridge the main story. A shame given how many elements were tied to this girl that actually could have included other characters in the picture.-And in the case of the teenager, she felt like an accessory designed to pull in the loose ends and shakily glue them together in a menagerie that didn't quite come together for me.-The end product is manageable but falls short of what BlumHouse has put out in the past, and not even the campiness elevates the limitations.Lack Of Suspense/Thrills/Scares
-Horror movies are all about the scares or thrills for most of the entries in the genre.-In this movie, I felt that only about ten percent of the movie had traces of these elements for me to enjoy and contrasted the trailer's promises.-Chauncey can be creepy at times. The way those eyes stare and the looming shadowy presence are a few examples of a horror element done right for me.-But it never elevates much past that, often delivering lackluster jump scares or comical moments that were supposed to be scary.-Once the turn in direction took place, the nightmare moments practically evaporated, and now starting to approach Tim Burton's styles of design. -This style does have its disturbing factor to it but Imaginary didn't take it that level and pulled punches that again were more humorous than terrifying.-The most disappointing element was the revelation of the monster's true form. Chauncey takes several uncomfortable transformations, but upon showing his true face, I wasn't impressed with the final result, especially at him doing very little despite the powers he possessed.The VERDICT:
Imaginary is a movie that held a lot of potential for me when I watched the trailers. Sadly, only a little bit of this potential was achieved for me in this viewing. The acting is fine and creates some engaging character moments that work well with the PG-13 rating. It has a story with some unique elements and some potential creative setups for scares, while also not treading too far into disturbing levels. There is an atmosphere of comedy embedded that at times brought out a laugh or two in me. However, the movie does not finish any of these elements strongly and struggles to keep the balance between fright and fun just right. The result becomes a mundane film that could be a beginner-level horror movie that only stands out in a few spots as the creepy piece it aspired to be. I can't recommend this movie for a theater showing, instead looking to a night at home as your venue of choice. Who knows, being at home might enhance the scare factor a bit.My scores for the film are:
Horror/Mystery/Thriller: 5.5
Movie Overall: 5.0."," Not Quite What You Imagine"
"183","Imaginary","vengeance20","2/10","9 March 2024","Wasn't expecting much from this & only saw a pretty unimaginative (pardon the pun), trailer for the film last year until sweet fa until recently. Like I said, I wasn't expecting much from this as it didn't sell it to me, but, I thought it might be good given Jeff Wadlow, the director of Kick-Ass 2 & Truth Or Dare was behind this. So, naturally, I thought it might be good...A woman returns to her childhood home to discover that the imaginary friend she left behind is very real & unhappy that she abandoned him.I found the film to be pretty tame. While the premise & concept were ok, it was poorly executed. If you thought M3gan & Night Swim were bad, look out, this takes the cake. The film has more cons than pros, the pros being the what little horror we got. Then there's the cons... jeez, where to start...Oh yeah, the film is 1 hour & 40 minutes too long (100 minutes) & has really bad pacing issues especially towards the end. It didn't half out stay its welcome by the time the 3rd act rolled around. It was annoying as the sluggish pacing was bad enough from the start, but by the end, man, it really irritated me & just when you thought the film was ending, more came.The characters were bland & annoying. Of course, with it being 2024, there was some modern references in the cast & of course, all the male characters were portrayed as weak, bad or non existent in the film. Even the imaginary friend was a male, typical...But anyway, with that came the lack of scares, the juvenile monsters you see & the dumb, goofy effects. Not to mention the uneven, out there story, the lack of realism & just the disengaged feel & watch of the film. You just couldn't get into it & it became quite a chore to watch after the first 40 minutes or so.The film was more talky talk, drawn out drama than horror & scares which were little to non-existent, ok, there was some scary visuals but they weren't that great in themselves. I also couldn't help but feel there was a sort of message in the film, about men not being needed, I don't know, but from the portrayal of the characters, it's pretty plain to see...Overall, it's a pretty weak & annoying watch of a film. This film didn't cut it & was utter tripe from start to finish. Weak characters, weak story, weak effects & an over bloated runtime with pacing so slow, even slugs would be squirming with frustration just to get to the end.2/10."," Imaginary Tripe"
"184","Imaginary","Molly_flower","4/10","23 March 2024","Ironically, I feel like the movie lacked some imaginative ideas for a movie like this. Also, is it me or is nothing actually that scary anymore? The actors weren't bad, they would only act out what's in front of them but I liked the idea of this movie a lot but not what was delivered, sadly. Also, I didn't see any need for the husband to even be in the movie, that felt like a pointless character to be trimmed out. Additionally, there is always the same kind of family dynamics in these movies with a miserable angsty teenager etc, would have been cool to make the movie stand out and not always follow the samey blueprint."," Lacked some imagination"
"185","Imaginary","kevin_robbins","4/10","8 March 2024","My wife and I attended a screening of the Blumhouse film Imaginary (2024) last night. The storyline revolves around a woman with a tragic past who marries a man with two children, all moving into the stepmother's childhood home. As they attempt to adapt to their new life, the ghosts from their past, both figuratively and literally, resurface.Directed by Jeff Wadlow (Kick-Ass 2), the film stars DeWanda Wise (Jurassic World Dominion), Thomas Payne (The Walking Dead), Taegen Burns (The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers), Pyper Braun (Erin & Aaron), and Betty Buckley (Split).Despite its potential with all of the worthwhile elements, the movie falls short in putting everything together. While the family dynamic and characters are well-established, the revelation of the plot's intricacies causes the film to unravel. DeWanda Wise delivers a solid performance, and Pyper Braun's child acting feels authentic. The horror elements show promise with a few effective jump scares and one notable, albeit more fun than good, kill scene. However, the poorly written and overacted character of the old lady detracts from the overall experience. The film's conclusion, despite a couple of clever twists, fails to salvage the narrative.In conclusion, Imaginary possesses the ingredients for a worthwhile horror film but falters in execution. I'd give it a 4/10 and recommend skipping it."," Imaginary possesses the ingredients for a worthwhile horror film but falters in execution"
"186","Imaginary","kfzkqdnsm","2/10","28 March 2024","It's just not scary. The cast aren't convincing enough, obviously not used to acting in a horror film. The storyline is confused in itself and doesn't know which direction to go in. Make up is so amateur; you can see the plastic on faces.The actors just seem to go through the motions. They don't give any impression that they are being pursued by the 'Entity', do not show any fear in their faces.The script seems to have stolen plots from 'Poltergeist' and 'The Conjuring'. But it just doesn't work. There are so many holes in the plot. Where was the girls father? Why didn't the mum ring him and tell him what was happening? Why wasn't the little girl showing any signs of being frightened?Don't waste your time. Or your money."," Oh no ..."

Bear with me here.If you love ""horror"" movies where a child all by her lonesome descends stairs into a dark and dirty cellar where creepy noises emanate from, why, oh who cares if no kid would ever do this in like, ever.If you get creeped out by a Swifty taking a selfie and in the background of that photo, yikes! Lookout! There's some old lady neighbor photobombing, and she's got to be at least in her sixties!Terrifying!The acting and writing are tiresome and totally unbelievable.

"189","Imaginary","cruise01","6/10","9 March 2024","3 out of 5 stars.Imaginary is a fair supernatural horror film with a concept about children's imaginary friends becoming some evil entity in a spirit world. Its a bit of poltergeist like film. The film has some cheesy dialogue and it lacks the scares and horror. Which it could have added jump scares and be a little intense to make this film worthy.The plot follows Jessica (DeWanda Wise) as she and her new family with her step children move into her old childhood home. After a tragedy happened with her and her father at the house that left her dad speechless and traumatized. Her step daughter Alice comes across a teddy bear which she makes out to be an imaginary friend which becomes very sinister.The cast ensemble was okay. The story was decent. The script was a bit cheesy with the dialogue. And the direction with Jeff Wadlow has been lacking with providing any scares or intensity. Yes the characters come across something evil and the way it was filmed. It failed to even put you on the edge of your seat. Interesting concept but failed to execute the scares.Overall, it was an okay film that failed to deliver on scares and thrills."," Creepy premise with a direction that lacks scares and thrills."
"190","Imaginary","Otkon","3/10","10 March 2024","From the start, this movie is off. I don't like a single character. None of their motivations seems true. I don't buy Jessica as a children's book author and illustrator. I can't stand the two girls and their overacting. The creepy neighbor boy. Why is there even a Dad? And why is he British when that actor was in a failed TV FOX show with a passable American accent? And Mrs Bradford next-door was stupid.The rest of the movie is corny. The artist lady is in sun dresses and flats throughout the runtime. Outfits that are not at all conducive to fighting supernatural baddies.

"191","Imaginary","bladebk","1/10","9 March 2024","Just returned from watching this film, so it's very fresh in my mind (unfortunately).Never have I been in such a packed cinema watching a so called 'horror' film, where there has been absolutely no atmosphere whatsoever. It's like the film sucked the Life out of every single person. Even during the so called jump scares no one moved an inch. Such a bizarre experience.The problem was always going to be 'can you make a cuddly toy scary' and the answer is a resounding NO. Combine that with a paper thin back story, throw in a whinging brat and some terrible older actors and you end up with this mess of a film.The dialogue was really weak and unclear. For the whole first half of the film I thought they were calling the bear 'Jonty', but it turns out to be 'chauncy' or something along those lines. Ironically, it's not until the Spanish actress playing the psychiatrist says his name halfway in that I actually realised what they were saying.BTW, Special mention goes to the old woman in the film, who's hammy acting made me laugh like I've not done for years.

There's a bit of Poltergeist, a bit of Nightmare on Elm Street, a bit of Labyrinth - and it's unclear whether this is meant as an homage-melange, or a pilfering of tropes from a variety of better films.The film relies heavily on jump-scares, but there's little sense of terror. The twists can be seen coming a mile away. The ending is frankly lazy.The cast do their best. Young Pyper Braun is good as the girl at the centre of things, DeWanda Wise OK as the step-mother trying to penetrate the mystery. The rest are either under-used or let down by a thin script and unimaginative direction (or both).The special effects budget was clearly painfully small, and no-one was able to anything convincing or scary with it.Not a film that will live long in the memory."," Part homage, part re-tread, partly successful."
"193","Imaginary","r96sk","5/10","14 March 2024","Pyper Braun merits praise, 'Imaginary' otherwise falls flat.I was never locked into the story and I didn't really care for the characters at any point, even Braun's Alice isn't all that interesting despite a rather great performance from the young actress. DeWanda Wise is a bit dull, while Tom Payne disappoints somewhat - I mean he only has a small role, sure, but his acting is unconvincing... and I know he can actor far better, as seen during his time on TV's 'The Walking Dead'.The antagonists in this are poorly utilized, the poster bear is prevalent but very boring. It needed a Chucky-esque portrayal, rather than the blank stare we get every few minutes. The ending also drags, I thought it was going to end sooner a few times but it kept finding new ways to stick around; nothing majorly grating, granted. The score is at least OK.It also, amusingly, took me ages to work out what the bear's name was. I'm not familiar with the name ""Chauncey"", so genuinely for the longest time thought the name was either ""John C"" or ""Shaun C"".

I understand that this film is pg-13, but there are so many pg-13 films that are good (The Ring, The Grudge, etc) that this shouldn't hold them back.

This was made worse as other times the camera work was excellent in composition as well as lighting and sound bearing hallmarks of quality movie making. The high drama aspect required to create chills didn't hit at all and dialogue in places seemed to be very low effort.

I've been keenly anticipating this films release because the trailer intrigued me.Imaginary friends is something very relatable for most people either as part of their childhood, a siblings or their own children, grandchildren etc.In other words we've all known someone who's come through this grist mill and out the otherside.So, what if the imaginary friend was not as amicable as you'd think, now we have the premise for great Brisbane Horror Movie Events, but sadly we don't, not even close.Writer, Director Jeff Wadlow has given us so many nightmares in the past with his other creations, however this ain't one of my 99 problems.When they finally reveal who ""See Bee"" is it should be terrifying and instead it's like ""Five Night's At Freddy's"" & "" Megan's"" creators lame, big hairy, ""Chauncey"" Beast with very sharp teeth and claws.As soon as I learned puppeteers were involved my pulse rate dropped.Not exactly enough to instil fear in most adults.To be fair the movie is aimed more at a teen/tween audience with it's ""M"" rating in Australia.Talking to randoms in the lift after this advance screening we all felt the same...a bit let down because it's no ""Talk To Me""!Having said that you still don't want creepy bears laying around your house or are they?In ""Imaginary"" a woman of colour (DeWanda Wise as ""Jessica"") returns to her childhood home that really needs the walls painted to get rid of her so-called art to discover that the imaginary friend she left behind ""Chauncey Bear"" is very real and unhappy that she abandoned him.Tom Payne as hipster pop star husband ""Max"" is wasted and only used in a few scenes.Betty Buckley as the creepy old neighbour ""Gloria"" is fairly predictable.Pyper Braun as ""Alice"", ""Jessica's"" young step daughter is a find, while Taegen Burns"" as ""Taylor"" the other step daughter is such a cookie cutter teenage angst character.Poor Samuel Salary as ""Jessica's"" mentally ill father is not earning his salary with his whites of his eyes rolling trickery.While Matthew Sato as teenage next door neighbour ""Liam"" is a punk ass weak character.I know what you're thinking I've got to stop holding back and write what i'm really thinking.It's a concept that could and should have been more terrifying than Freddy Kruger's Nightmares.If ""Poltergeist"" really was an influence on Wadlow's latest flick then it sadly doesn't show on the big screen."," What Walt's Watching"
