"1","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","doberman-75778","7/10","26 February 2022","I just saw the movie with my Family and we really enjoyed it... as I saw the originals I was 9 years old and now my son watched this one in the same age. I would recommend this movie, even with kids younger than 12 years."," A Family Movie with funny and a little scary moments..."
"2","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","aa-09317","9/10","6 January 2022","Best recreation of a formulaic 80s blockbuster since the 90s. Funny dialog that was just self aware enough to be enjoyable. It's been a long time since I watched a movie at home without picking up my phone. This movie held my attention and kept me entertained for the whole film."," Super fun and well done."
"3","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","nasuivalentin","10/10","10 January 2022","This is a wonderful casted and played movie, with a heart warming nostalgia moment here and there, that also stands out on it's own as a very fun new adventure. Everything was great about it, totally recommend."," Absolutely worth a watch"
"4","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","bryancy","8/10","20 November 2021","I hadn't read much about the movie before going, so I didn't realize that this time kids would be carrying the film. However, they were a good choice for the roles and great actors! Logan Kim added humor and was reminiscent of Ray's character, Finn Wolfhard was the perfect self conscious and sweet teenage big brother and McKenna Grace was phenomenal as the fearless, child science genius! Although her character was more mature, she also reminded me of Nick Solinski in ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids."" I enjoyed Celeste O'Connor as her tough acting character and would've liked to have seen her more involved in the ""busting."" Yes, Paul Rudd nailed the charming science teacher and Carrie Coon pulled off the resentful (rightfully so) daughter and no nonsense single mom. Both were hilarious as their alter egos! I felt that the movie was going full steam until it approached the ending. I'm trying not to give any spoilers but it's not that it was bad- it was just not an original storyline and it could've been! (Think of all of the villains the Marvel industry comes up with) It was touching and clever how they were able to integrate all four of the original Ghostbusters. Overall I am really glad to have seen this movie in the theater with the satisfying special effects, action and chase scenes. I think you will enjoy it and should watch it over this holiday season!"," Fun, Feel Good Film for the Family"
"5","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","camerynames","8/10","23 November 2021","It was kinda slow at first and kinda didn't make sense for a minute but over the corse of the movie everything begins to be explained. I do recommend seeing the original ghost busters movie first though."," Pretty good"
"6","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","aaronjcarter-06923","10/10","20 November 2021","The cinematography, story and characters brought back so much nostalgia and I honestly loved it so much. Definitely a 10/10 movie and the best movie I've watched all year so far!!"," This movie was so amazing"
"7","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","liampmcqal","8/10","20 November 2021","Honestly I loved it, the visuals, the story and the characters (Podcast being my favourite). Another great part was Egon's ghost, it looked just like an old Harold Ramis. The only thing that I wasn't a big fan of was that the original cast only appearing at the end."," One word... AWESOME!"
"8","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","chuckp-23023","10/10","1 December 2021","Perfect tribute to Egon!!!! The way they did this movie I am glad they went that way. The 2016 Ghostbusters was complete trash. I will see this movie over and over. Like the origionals I enjoyed it all. Thank you maker's of this version I was hoping for a ghost Egon. That is the only thing I wanted to see in this version. RIP Egon."," Great movie"
"9","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","prayudhaekatama","8/10","7 June 2022","I quite understand that this is not a film that can be accepted by all audience segments. For me who was born in the early 80's, this sequel connects well with the two early prequels (Ghostbusters I & II).What's interesting is the use of a ""family"" theme and a small town setting, giving it a different feel compared to its prequels which are centered on the ""business"" theme of exorcism services and set in a big city. Coupled with the absence of the late Harold Ramis (RIP) it was successfully adapted and added depth to the story (for those who are familiar with Ghostbusters, it will be touching).The scene for a few seconds when Ecto-1 was speeding in the field, although not something fancy for today's standards, made my child's soul burst.I really enjoy what you present Mr. Reitman, very grateful!PS: Honestly, I was a little worried when I heard that there would be another sequel after this. Hopefully they find a good script so that later it doesn't feel as repetitive as Ghostbusters I & II."," Popcorn from the 80s. not perfect, but tasty!"
"10","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","scottcopperpot","10/10","23 November 2021","Just watched the film last night, really enjoyed it! If you are a ghostbusters fan, then this will most definitely hit all the right points. The film has a great cast and amazing special effects that are also present in the film. It also contains many nice nods (easter eggs) that true fans will be able to spot and enjoy. Great little film altogether and this is a must watch for anybody out there that are either a fan of the ghostbuster's films or equally for anyone out there that may just like to enjoy family friendly, horror / fantasy films. The film itself is set within the ghostbuster's universe were films 1 and 2 still exist and are still canon but decides to mainly focus more on the first film's history rather than the 2nd film. Great soundtracks without the film, many which are also present with in the firsts film, which really help to add to the familiarity of the film and also helps to build upon tense scenes in the film."," Very good!"
"11","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","alanclethro","8/10","6 February 2022","After the previous one and other remakes I'm always sceptical to start it's fair to say!But, sorry to say only managed to watch it on tv rental, but thankful I do.Great cast, similar script but, in the end it matters not! Enough nods to the old original and cast to make it a throughly watchable and enjoyable flick!!!!"," Thoroughly enjoyable"
"12","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","s-98407","8/10","27 November 2021","Well made. Great acting. This movie deserves all the views it can get. Ghostbusters:Afterlife is a great throwback to the 1980's and it is a very sweet movie. For Harold."," Ghostbusters"

"14","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","millerea-19794","10/10","22 February 2022","A really awesome reboot to attract the newest generation, while still keeping true to original story for us old-timers. Plenty of action, special effects and heart warming moments. Great acting across the board.

"15","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","jacobgarwoodfilms","10/10","30 December 2021","Being completely honest, I was not a fan of the 2016 film (I also know that doesn't set me apart). But THAT is how you make a sequel. The tone of the film was respectful yet still a comedy. It wasn't piece to piece of fan service. Of course they have scenes where there is fan service, but it was tasteful and wasn't trying to tease us into thinking that if they brought back original props, they will love this.Each character was well crafted (except for the mom, more on that later), but having the daughter pick up a mantle of Egon and having her piece together pieces that allows her to solve the mystery and just get everything together, was simply amazing.The mom however, was the weakest part. Her entire persona throughout the movie was playing a hurt daughter. But she didn't really do anything likable to earn her a resolving ending. And that is the biggest flaw of this film.Like Harold, said on the commentary of the original 1984 Ghostbusters, ""this movie was about a coming into Buisness film"". It was a comedy about three guys (plus one later) getting kicked out and starting a Buisness to hunt and trap ghosts.And obviously, in the second film Ghostbusters goes under because there is no good Buisness plan for hunting ghosts.In the third, it just makes sense that they kept capturing them, but eventually they would go away. But ALSO to quote Egon from the 2009/2019 video game, ""new people die each day"". (Which is also cannon).Now to stop my rambling: this movie in terms of where Ghostbusters was, where Ghostbusters is, and where Ghostbusters is going. I have high hopes for the future films that are coming. And they better be coming because I love this series too much to let it go back into...well...the 2016 version."," Ghostbusters is BACK!"
"16","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","bigsimmo-60932","10/10","21 November 2021","After the disappointment of GB 2016, this is what the franchise needed and what I have been waiting for since I was 5 years old. I was taken back to 1991 as watched the movie. Sat in awe as the nostalgia hit me in feelings like a freight train. It felt fresh and new with lots of nods to the first movie. Great to see a new generation of ghostbusters with plenty of potential for future movies. Heartfelt, and beautiful dedication to Harold who's memory lives on though this fantastic experience."," Just perfect."
"17","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","dalmolingaston","10/10","14 January 2022","After the 2016 reboot, I thought that this franchise was over, for bad...But the trailer showed me that the thought on every little aspect of the original movie. The plot continue with the same information that they have in the first movie and expand it perfectly.The characters where maybe a little bit too stereotyped, but they did exactly what, I think, they should do.First ""third"" movie that it's worth watching, in my opinion."," ghostbusters afterlife"
"18","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","mjcrane-83288","9/10","3 December 2021","There are just 2 Ghostbusters films worth watching: the original and this one. Both are funny, exciting and entirely memorable.The young cast in Afterlife are perfectly strong enough to carry the film although with such a great supporting cast and brilliant writing there is little to worry about.I'm sure it's been said 1000 times already but think Stranger Things meets Goonies meets Ghostbusters and this is what you have here."," Everything you'd hope for..."
"19","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","hunterfrady","10/10","20 November 2021","If you're a ghostbusters fan this movie should be Atleast a 9 out of 10. If you're not, you're probably not going to understand why the user reviews are so different from the critic reviews. 2016 made fans angry not because of the female cast, but because they failed to listen to their fans. In fact they then alienated them. This movie brings back 1984, reminding us about Egon,Ray, Winston, and Peter. It reminds us that they aged, grew apart, found new lives, and even die. That said they still loved each other as any best friends do. So yes, we have new characters. Characters that honestly did themselves justice and hopefully carry the torch. We also find this movie to be a fitting tribute to an absolute legend of comedy, as well as a character that we felt we grew up with. For some of us this is the movie we have waited through 20+ years of rumors for. RIP Harold, thank you for everything. Those tears from Dan, Bill, and Ernie were real! Those tears from us were real."," A fitting tribute"
"20","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","glynn-17442","10/10","20 November 2021","Absolutely spot on, Jason Reitman did the Ghostbusters community proud, wonderful amazing spectacular, references everywhere for us in the GB community, a worthy and welcome sequel to the original two films, literally can't express how much of an emotional ride this was, spot on."," Waited 30 odd years for this"
"21","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","vickyevans-30403","10/10","20 November 2021","Pretend the 3rd one didn't happen.Just focus on the perfect originals. This is the best follow on we could have asked for. It has everything; twists, references to the originals, the same orchestration, it'll make you nostalgic and happy and sad all at the same time.All the kids are great actors and the delightful Paul Rudd does NOT disappoint.I've just left the cinema and I would happily go back and watch it all again right now. I loved itAnd take tissues - it gets emotional."," The perfect homage to the originals"
"22","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","timmyshane","9/10","20 November 2021","The original 84 movie is often cited as ""lightning in a bottle"", where the characters seemed believable, interactive and curious. The plot has holes that they put there with babble and jokes. It's great.I've read most of the ""poor reviews"" so far for this movie, and here's the categories the fall into:
If you're a critic and you didn't like it- this movie just isn't for you. You don't appreciate it, and you're not the audience. I can't expect Gene Siskel to watch a kids movie and enjoy as much as, say, a kid.If you're a regular viewer and didn't like it: you didn't LOVE the first movie. One reviewer on here said that the 2016 one was just as good as the original- and that's flat out wrong. GBAL is a beautiful love letter to the franchise, and after reading the comments- you're not the audience either. You may THINK you are and that's why this is confusing for you.So that said- the movie was exceptional. I laughed when I was supposed to laugh, I embraced the mystery of it all, and on top of it all I got misty at the end. Beautiful movie with a perfect homage to those who made all of this possible.. The familiar faces brought in weren't ruined by social effects or attempts to ""Princess Leia"" them into the movie with old footage and recycled audio. It's certainly nostalgic, and sweetly so rather than the over bearing way Star Wars attempts. They've done their homework and learned from the mistakes of other franchises. I can only hope they continue this with as much vigor and love as they put into it.If you LOVE the original, it's for you. How do you know if it's for you?""Where do these stairs go?""
..
If you said ""They to Up"", they go see the movie. If you didn't get the reference, maybe watch the original one a few more times."," If you gave this less than a 8, you're dead wrong"
"23","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","fordpg","8/10","20 November 2021","I on the other hand, give it an 8. But, still, go see it!!My thoughts:
*Idk what that green thing is, but it better not be Slimer?*I am a huge fan of GB1, and GB2, Soundtracks.With that being said, the score did deliver. The Soundtrack didn't do so much for me*I wanted to see a little more of Dan, Bill and Ernie. Especially Ernie. He was always my 2nd favorite (to Venkman)*I thought there were some areas of the movie that may have needed explanations*Great nostalgia. Great Introduction with the new cast members and a great tribute. Definitely some tear jerking moments. I'd still go see it again!8/10."," The Mrs. gives it 10 Stars!!!"

"25","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","steelers-47200","10/10","23 November 2021","All the callbacks to the original as well as the original cast being back made it a long awaited great sequel. Can't wait to see where they take it. The end of the Gozer story was good as well!"," Loved it!"
"26","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","Coventry","8/10","2 December 2021","About ten months before the release of ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"", and without any knowledge whatsoever that a belated sequel was in production, I re-watched the 1984 original for the first time in 25 years, and together with own kids (aged six and ten). Needless to say, my offspring wasn't the least bit impressed with special effects from the early eighties, and to be totally honest, I found that my childhood favorite had badly dated as well.My biggest regret was that I couldn't pass on that magical feeling of ""discovering"" the world of horror, monsters, F/X, and ectoplasm! But when we saw publicity for the brand new ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" on television, it were my children who spontaneously asked if we could go and see it on the big screen. So, yes, with a slight delay they experienced how I felt when I saw ""Ghostbusters"" for the first time. And I felt 9 years old again, myself.Undoubtedly the best thing that could have happened to the franchise, especially after the flopped 2016-remake, was a return to the roots. The story links straight back to the original, the beloved protagonists show up (albeit briefly) and the co-writer/director is none other than the son of Ivan Reitman; - Jason. ""Afterlife"" is chock-full of gimmicks references towards the original, varying from subtle to plain obvious. The young cast members are refreshing, and fit wonderfully well in the ""Ghostbusters"" universe, but it feels even better to reconnect with the old-fashioned familiar trumps, like the legendary Ghostbusters-vehicle and - of course - the Ray Parker Jr. Theme song. The homage to Harold Ramis, one of the creators of the original concept and the only cast member who passed away, is beautiful."," What it feels like to be nine years old again!"
"27","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","Sleepin_Dragon","8/10","21 November 2021","I'll be honest, after the last Ghostbusters movie, I wasn't keen on it, reluctantly I went along, and have to admit, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It feels like a worthy successor to the original film, it doesn't just ignore the past, it supports it. I would advise seeing the original movie ahead of this, as there is a lot of nostalgia surrounding it. I feel like they wanted it to respect the original, that it does.Some really nice special effects, a few perhaps not so good, but that's just me being picky. A good atmosphere, and a really good pace, there's nothing slow about the film, it doesn't lull, nor did it feel overlong. It's a bit goofy, it doesn't take itself too seriously.Great to see some old, familiar faces, if you're a fan of the original, you really will love the nostalgia vibe. Paul Rudd was awesome I thought, he stood out for me.8/10."," Surprisingly good."
"28","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","lareval","8/10","19 November 2021","The first 'Ghostbusters' is one of the most beloved movies of my childhood. The second one gets critized sometimes but I think it's as good as the first. Let's forget that embarrassing awful movie that took place in the 2010's and finally focus on this one: THE TRUEST THIRD MOVIE OF 'GHOSTBUSTERS'. I had no hype for this one (mostly because of the trainwreck that out-of-place-2010's movie), but I felt somewhat compelled to give the benefit of the doubt and realise if my fears were right or wrong... I'll tell you this: watch this movie!It is a heartfelt, coherent and fun story that pays respect to its roots and moves forward the saga on a loving way. The plot hasn't been revealed too much because of a key reason and even if someone has been sadly spoiled, when that part occurs in silver screen is just downright marvelous. But not just that peak: the movie has several peaks. The characters were much, much better than I expected thanks to great and compelling performances. Finally we go back to some terror and some suspenseful sequences that harck back to that so damn missed old style from the eighties. The CGI is good, the soundtrack is on point and the script never dragged to me.All in: a pleasent surprise. If the story ends here, it is the best finale they ever could have pulled off. Whatever happens in the future, this movie made its work so right and so enjoyable (with a truly emotional ending in which I cried) and that's all that matters. This is a joyful, emotional throwback call that must be seen!"," Finally!! A movie that's worthy of the legacy of the first two!"
"29","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","UniqueParticle","9/10","18 November 2021","I absolutely loved this Ghostbusters definitely better than 2016 mess! This has everything you'd want in the series with comedy, amazing cinematography, great story I even went with a friend and he noticed a few plot holes I didn't even realize it had some; I think everything was the way it should be. So much exciting bits that are feel good and has the perfect amount of surprises. I'm glad I got to see the advanced screening and I really hope the film gets the recognition it deserves!"," That hit the spot especially in RPX"
"30","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","kosmasp","9/10","23 November 2021","I have to admit I had certain expectations and thought about seeing certain people/characters in this. Let's say if I was just rating the movie based on that, I probably would have rated it lower. I also missed out on the opportunity to rewatch the first two movies. But I don't think it would have mattered that much. Even a female character that had a small cameo in here, I sort of remembered her (small) part in the original movies.That being said this adds a few cool people - namely Paul Rudd and the kids. Especially the daughter and the kid who befriends her (Podcast) are a great team together. Really funny and with great respect to the movies that came before it. Maybe minus the one with the all female cast. Now I personally liked that too - if you didn't enjoy that fair enough, can't compare those two anyway.So much weirdness and comedy that works here, because of the script and because of the actors. And yes many flashbacks still - that even if you don't have the movies fresh in your memory work wonders. Also stay through the credits - one mid credits scene and one after credit scene."," Ghostbusters the next Generation"

"32","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","DarkVulcan29","9/10","29 November 2021","Feels like a Ghostbusters film with a little Stranger Things mixed in. I'd rather tell you too much about the story, cause I don't want to give too much away, but I gotta say it's a new Ghostbusters film with some feeling of nostalgia. The characters are a joy to watch, and the effects are pretty good also.I admire the film does pay homage To Harold Ramis who passed away in 2014. Who was co writing genius with Dan Aykroyd of the two Ghostbusters film. And a great director of such great comedy classics like Caddyshack(1980) and Groundhog Day(1992).

"33","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","garethvk","9/10","16 November 2021","Back in 1984 when big hair and neon were the norms; a movie appeared that soon became a cultural phenomenon. The movie involved a team of unlikely Paranormal Investigators and the mix of comedy, FX, and Ghosts turned the movie into a smash hit and a Pop Culture mainstay. The abundance of products that followed and the inescapable theme song and tagline soon gave rise to a sequel which while a success; did not resonate the way the original film had and thus the ""Ghostbusters"" film franchise became dormant.While a successful video game and merchandise line kept the franchise alive; the 2016 reboot with an all-female team failed to capture the magic at the box office and again put the franchise's cinematic future in question.Thankfully after several delays due to the Covid 19 Pandemic; ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" has arrived and is the worthy sequel that does justice to the original film and sets the stage well for future cinematic exploits.The film follows a down on her luck mother named Callie )Carrie Coon) and her children Trevor (Finn Wolfhard); and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace), as they are forced to move to a dilapidated farm in rural Oklahoma following the passing of Callie's estranged father and her subsequent eviction.A series of unexplained earthquakes clues the smart and precocious Phoebe that something is up and with her new friend Podcast (Logan Kim), and teacher Mr. Grooberson (Paul Rudd); help her uncover her connection to the original Ghostbusters and the abundance and significance of the gear that her Grandfather has left on the farm.Things soon take a turn for the worse and despite skeptical locals and the emerging danger, Phoebe, Trevor, and their friends have to battle the forces of evil to save the world.The movie takes its time getting to the action and spends plenty of time establishing the characters, their motivations, and their relationships with one another. There are abundant homages to the original film; some of which are very subtle and clever but never seem gratuitous or tacked on.The film also does not rely on the FX to tell the tale as while there are some solid effects in the film; this is a character-driven tale and the new cast works well with some surprise guests who pop up throughout the film.Director Jason Reitman; son of the Director of the original film; clearly knows and loves the material as he not only helped craft the story but deftly weaves a new tale into the franchise which also fits well with the first film and does not attempt to reboot but rather continue the franchise.There are two extra scenes in the credits that you will not want to miss as not only are they great fun; but also tease of future adventures to come.The film also has a few touching moments that caused some unexpected emotion from the audience at our Press Screening and helped establish ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" as not only a winning entry into the series but also one of the most enjoyable films of the year.4.5 stars out of 5."," Ghostbusters Afterlife Is A Winning Entry In The Series And One Of The Most Enjoyable Films Of The Year"

"38","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","masonsaul","9/10","19 November 2021","Shifting genres into an Amblin adventure, Ghostbusters: Afterlife is an incredibly heartfelt reboot that's extremely heartwarming and funny enough to earn its title. Overall, the plot strays too close to the original but with Jason Reitman writing and directing there's a uniquely personal aspect to the nostalgia that makes it unexpectedly emotional.Mckenna Grace gives an incredible lead performance, strong enough to carry the film without the need to rely on original cast members. Paul Rudd is just so likeable as usual and Carrie Coon brings a lot of flawed relatability to her character. Celeste O'Connor, Logan Kim, Finn Wolfhard all give great supporting performances and have strong chemistry.Jason Reitman's direction is fantastic. The car chases are real standouts and the film has a real momentum as it switches between sincere character beats and ghostbusting. The visual effects have a clear reverence for the originals and there's some impressive practical effects here as well. Rob Simonsen's score is content to coast on the classics, aided by an easygoing soundtrack."," Incredibly heartfelt reboot"
"39","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","kuarinofu","5/10","8 January 2022","The title reflects the way Egon Spengler would've described this. I'll keep this short.I want to say right away that this review reflects purely my individual point of view. And as a viewer who is tired of the constant stimulation of those parts of the brain that are responsible for nostalgia (due to most of the old franchises being constantly milked) I was absolutely insensitive to all such moments in the film.That's why the film itself turned out to be completely hollow for me, apart from a very beautiful visual aspect, there's absolutely nothing in it. If you imagine for a couple of minutes that the original film was never made, or that you haven't seen it, there's nothing left in this movie for you.Every single scene, event, line of dialogue, visual of the first two films are referenced in this. Moreover, apparently, there is absolutely nothing going on in the lives of these characters unrelated to the names and events of past films.I was ready to rate this product a 7 out of 10 even though I did not enjoy it. But the (expected) CGI ending made me feel miserable. I really don't understand why they did that.There are more respectful ways to pay tribute to Harold. And the worst thing is that I hoped they wouldn't, but they did.In the end, mostly due to the first scene after the credits, which was the best part of the whole thing, I stopped at 5 out of 10.If you're up for a 2 hour ""remember this?"" ride - check it out. It's a well-produced product.If you love Ghostbusters for what they were - sharp funny dialogue, relatable and memorable characters, the sense of adventure, and the venture into entrepreneurship...I mean, at this point you probably stopped caring."," An expertly crafted commercial product prepared for a specific audience for the purpose of prolonged stimulation of nostalgic sentiments"

"41","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","paulclaassen","4/10","24 January 2022","The Ghostbusters reboot 'Ghostbusters: Answer the Call' featured all female Ghostbusters. Now with 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' we have ghostbuster kids.... Ugh, give me a moment to recover...Ghostbuster KIDS!! Honestly! The idea - or sight - of 12-year old kids acting as ghostbusters is just not interesting or believable. Seeing them face to face with ghosts, demons, goblins, etc while they just stand their making jokes while zapping them is not exactly my idea of fun. This movie is for kids.Considering the excellent visual effects in the original 'Ghostbusters' way back in 1984, the visuals in 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' is nothing to write home about. It's good, make not mistake, but compared to what they've accomplished almost four decades ago, it was nothing special.'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' is also very slow. I mean, this film truly moves at a snail's pace. The original film was so much fun and excitement, whereas this film was pretty much about kids making jokes. The 'love interest' between Trevor and Lucky felt so forced and annoying, while Callie and Grooberson could have allowed for a far better love interest. Then again, as mentioned, this is a children's movie, so I guess they opted for a teen love interest. Pfff!!Oh, no, look, Marshmallows again!! These marshmallows felt like Gremlins-wannabes, or even Minions wannabes. This is the part where I just shook my head in disbelief...The film will no doubt garner a fan base due to the appearance of the original Ghostbusters - Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and Ernie Hudson (and even Harold Ramis in ghost form...). As for me, unfortunately 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' did nothing for my senses. There's a lot of noise and light flashes during the film's climax; I mean jeez! Oh, I suppose I should lighten up, sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is.... ugh, no, scrap that, I didn't like this movie at all. Ghostbuster kids....pff!!!!!Would I watch it again? No."," Ghostbuster KIDS!!!"
"42","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","JohnDeSando","9/10","21 November 2021","Just because I was alive for the original 1984 Ghostbusters doesn't mean you young'uns won't enjoy it as much as I do. Ghostbusters: Afterlife is an entertainment for the entire family: It has scary ghosts, nerdy kids, young teen romance, adult romance, and nostalgic special effects as well as equipment like a tricked-out Ectomobile, a portable nuclear particle accelerator, and a ghost trap, to name only a few to delight kids and adults, who may fondly remember analog.Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) as the science-friendly 12-year-old and her siblings, grandkids of an original Ghostbuster, move to a remote Oklahoma farm, the dilapidated ""Dirt"" estate. They encounter ghosts, as to be expected because gramps didn't quite finish the ghost-busting job from '84.The ghosts are a bit goofy (more like out-of-control dogs and marshmallows), and the stakes may not be earth-shattering, but the fun they have trying to capture the critters is a high-spirited chase coupled with a subtle lesson about the importance of family, legacy, and cooperation. The relevance of this classic-based tale is in the notion that working together is an answer to beating back intruders (COVID, anyone?).Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Harold Ramis appear (appropriately Ramis as ghost since he has left us in death to write about them somewhere), not enough but just enough to link the past to the present. This fourth iteration, and certainly the best of the sequels, will make you chuckle, maybe cry a little, scare you a tad, but never bore you.As adult romancers, Mr. Grooberson (Paul Rudd) and Callie (Carrie Coon) are charming and clueless enough for us to beg for more time with them. Finn Wolfhard (star of Stranger Things) as brother Trevor (just enough of Timothee Chalamet in his look) and the gifted comic kid, Logan Kim, as Podcast will make teens, and us all, quite happy with their shenanigans.A sweet comic atmosphere prevails over this successful sequel. I hope it's enough to get you back to the theater where hosts serve up comfy seats, knockout sound, and fantasy relief from the pandemic."," Nostalgic, comic sequel to a great classic.

Trevor gets a job at the local diner, where he can make moon eyes at cute and friendly local waitress Lucky. And scientist prodigy Phoebe connects with teacher and amateur seismologist Gary, keenly researching the inexplicable local earthquakes. She also becomes friendly with Podcast, a kid who makes podcasts about inexplicable scientific phenomena and constantly talks in 3rd party linking sequences. Phoebe discovers a lab in the basement where her grandfather worked. And she discovers that her grandfather was Egon Spengler...I liked the all-female Ghostbusters of several years ago, but that has been put to one side: this movie is effectively Ghostbusters 3 because it follows on in a number of ways from the original movies. The trailer shows us Dan Aykroyd reprising Ray Stantz and Paul Rudd as teacher Gary.But I'm pleased to say that the kids, and in particular Mackenna Grace's Phoebe, carry this film. The story is good, the cast are fine, the script is good fun with some lovely lines, the callbacks are effective, and the film has heart. There has been criticism that the film overdoes its fan service, but I felt this was integrated well into the story (contrast Solo, for instance)."," Great fun"
"44","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","zardoz-13","4/10","9 December 2021","Not only does the ""Ghostbusters"" sequel reboot ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" (*** out of ****) recapture the whimsical hilarity of the original movies, but it also amounts to a family affair. Jason Reitman, who co-wrote and directed ""Ghostbusters Afterlife,"" is Ivan Reitman's son, and Ivan directed the two Bill Murray ""Ghostbusters"" movies. Furthermore, Ivan also served as a producer on the reboot. Apart from Harold Ramis, who died at age 69 in 2014, and Rick Moranis (alive but retired), everybody else reprises their original roles. Despite quibbles, ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" is more faithful to the franchise than the previous, uninspired, gender-flipped ""Ghostbusters"" (2016). Jason Reitman has kept the family legacy intact with ""Ghostbusters Afterlife."" Anybody who enjoyed the supernatural shenanigans of the first (though not necessarily the second) ""Ghostbusters"" should relish this reboot. Reitman and co-scenarist Gil Kenan provide airtight continuity between ""Ghostbusters 2"" (1989) and ""Ghostbusters Afterlife."" A refreshing, young, first-rate cast, lighthearted CGI visual effects, and polished production values distinguish this 124-minute, PG-13 rated franchise update. The Reitmans have shown good taste in their reverential treatment of the Harold Ramis character. Appropriately, they portray Dr. Egon Spengler as an apparition now rather than an actual person. Don't rush for the exits when the end credits roll or you'll miss deleted footage of Harold Ramis from the 1984 ""Ghostbusters."" One of the delights of ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" is neither Kenan nor Reitman have tampered with the backstory of the franchise.Predictably, though it boils down to ""Ghostbusters: The Next Generation,"" Reitman's ""Afterlife"" focuses on Dr. Egon Spengler's family. Unfortunately, Kenan and Reitman crank up their reboot with Egon's demise. During an explosive opening gambit, Egon meets his monstrous match in a humongous phantom that has been hibernating in a nearby defunct mining cavern. Later, we learn Egon abandoned his colleagues, Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray of ""Stripes""), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Ackroyd of ""Doctor Detroit""), and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson of ""Machete Joe"") after their 'ghostbusting' business went belly up. Vanishing into the sprawling eternity of Oklahoma, Egon bought a secluded house in Summerville and prepared for a showdown with Gozer. Worshiped as a deity by ancient civilizations, Gozer was the Ghostbusters' prime adversary. Egon not only absconded with their iconic Cadillac ambulance Ecto-1, but he also took their equipment, including the Proton Blaster Packs, P. K. E. Meter, and the ghost Traps. Now, holed up in a dilapidated white farm, in the middle of nowhere, Egon has wired up his entire property so it resembles a backyard version of Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory. The tragedy of Egon's death is mitigated somewhat by the deafening fireworks during this encounter. ""Black Hawk Down"" Supervising Sound Editor Perry Robertson also provides nerve-racking jump scares when our protagonists wield the Proton Blasters. During the grand finale, when the original cast seals the continuity gap with ""Afterlife,"" you'll know Jason Reitman got it right. Meantime, the amusing miniature-sized Marshmallow Men in their cute sailor suits are back creating pandemonium, too.Dr. Spengler's daughter Callie (Carrie Coon of ""Avengers: Infinity War"") is a single mom with two kids. She has an unruly 16-year-old son Trevor (Finn Wofthard of ""The Gold Finch"") and a precocious, 12-year-old daughter Phoebe (Mckenna Grace of ""Malignant""), and they are all about to be evicted from their apartment for late rent. Conveniently, Egon dies, and Callie inherits his Summerville farmhouse. Naturally, Callie hopes the sell the place. Once she arrives in Summerville and beholds the property, she resigns herself to staying until she can dig herself out of debt. Callie enrolls Phoebe in summer school and meets Phoebe's teacher, Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd of the ""Ant-man"" movies), who runs a relaxed, laid-back class. Grooberson shows his students old horror movies like ""Cujo"" (1983), while he ponders a mysterious outbreak of earthquakes in the general vicinity. Phoebe impresses him with her knowledge of geology. Phoebe is the spitting image of Egon. She wears his nerdy spectacles and has his curly hair. Predictably, Grooberson and Callie hit it off while the kids explore the farmhouse. Phoebe finds Egon's P. K. E. Meter beneath a chair. Later, she rummages through Egon's secret basement laboratory, while Trevor discovers the Cadillac ambulance Ecto-1 parked under wraps in the barn. The automotive genius of the family, Trevor gets the Ecto-1 running in no time. Phoebe and her summer school pal Podcast (newcomer Logan Kim) take a Proton Blaster out for field trials. In the film's first, slam-bang sequence, Phoebe and Podcast accompany Trevor on a joyride in the Ecto-1. Phoebe sits in a seat that slides sideways out of the right rear passenger door. When they cruise into town, they spot a ghost named Muncher chewing up a fire hydrant. Basically, the kids destroy parts of Summerville in their efforts to capture Muncher. Imagine Callie's alarm when the police notify her about her children's antics. Waiting for Callie to bail them out of jail, Phoebe uses her one phone call to chat with Dr. Raymond Stantz. Little does Phoebe realize her father's colleagues are bound to descend on Summerville.Incredibly enough, ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" would have qualified as a good movie whether Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, and Ernie Hudson had reprised their roles. After Callie and her kids move into Egon's old quarters, the film adopts a ""Goonies"" (1985) vibe. Basically, Phoebe, Podcast, and Trevor behave like ""The Goonies."" As Phoebe, Mckenna Grace steals the show with her charismatic performance. Although Slimer is on hiatus, the CGI ghosts are every bit as outlandish as they were in the classic ""Ghostbusters"" movies. Olivia Wilde appears in an uncredited cameo as the evil Gozer. Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts have cameos, too. A goofy s√©ance of sorts, ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" gives this supernatural franchise a new lease on life."," The Original Ghostbusters are Back!"

"48","Ghostbusters: Afterlife","ferguson-6","5/10","18 November 2021","Greetings again from the darkness. There is a reason musical acts like The Eagles, Jimmy Buffet, and The Rolling Stones continue to pack arenas. We love our nostalgia and prefer it familiar and easily recognizable. The fans don't show up to hear the new songs, but rather those 'oldies-but-goodies' that bring back pleasant memories. Writer-director Jason Reitman and co-writer Gil Kenan fully understand this psychology as they deliver what amounts to a sequel of the original GHOSTBUSTERS movie released 37 years ago (and directed by Reitman's father Ivan).The hook in this updated version is that Callie (Carrie Coon), the adult daughter of original Ghostbuster Egon Spengler (originally portrayed by the late Harold Ramis), has been evicted from her apartment. She packs up the car and her two kids, and heads to the dilapidated farm house she inherited from the father she never knew. Callie has lived her life bitter and hurt that her father never reached out, choosing instead to isolate himself in Summerville in the ""middle of nowhere"". Her kids are Trevor (Finn Wolfhard), an awkward teenager, and Phoebe (a stellar McKenna Grace), a science whiz who seems to be a near-clone of the grandfather she never met.As they adjust to a new life, Trevor swoons over local girl Lucky (Celeste O'Connor), while Phoebe befriends another outcast self-named Podcast (Logan Kim), and Callie gets closer to Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd), a Seismologist ""teaching"" summer school with help from some age-inappropriate movies on VHS. As great as Coon and Rudd are (and both are great), the real fun comes from the youngsters exploring grandfather's workshop and the mysterious mountain at the edge of town, which is actually a long ago abandoned mine run by the town's founder.Supporting actors include Bokeem Woodbine, JK Simmons, and Tracy Letts. Many of the elements will seem familiar as the kids begin to uncover the ghostly creatures unlocked thanks to Grandpa Egon's research and tools. As with the original, busting the ghosts is fun, but it's the one-liners and crackling dialogue that make this a joyous ride from beginning to end. A battered Ectomobile (Ecto-1) plays a key role, as do ghost traps, crossing streams, and a new generation of Stay-Puft Marshmallows.Jason Reitman is a two-time Oscar nominee for UP IN THE AIR (2009) and JUNO (2007), but it seems clear his mission here was to provide a fitting tribute to the original film, his father, and the late Harold Ramis. He's assisted along the way with some special effects and even more special appearances, though the missing Rick Moranis is notable (and expected). The original blockbuster spawned sequels, re-boots, toys, an animated series, video games, documentaries, and now ... another sequel (one that mostly disregards everything but the original). There is a Spielberg feel as the scene is small town instead of NYC, and perhaps with this family-friendly focus on the kids, the best comparison might be THE GOONIES. It's nostalgic, yet new and fresh, and we do get a look at Hook and Ladder #8, and the familiar tune of Ray Parker Jr's iconic theme song. Hang on for the mid-credit and post-credit scenes, and just remember to take this for what it is ... a rollicking good time.Opening in theaters on November 19, 2021."," Dirt Farmer grandkids"

Suffice it to say I was really intrigued by this movie in trailers. I thought it would be a great opportunity to bring back some of the magic from our collective childhood while introducing the younger generations to a classic. I couldn't be more shocked and disappointed at how bad this is. I actually stopped watching it, decided I'd need to watch the whole thing to give it an honest review, then stopped watching again. Why? From the very beginning it just didn't work, on any level. Why would Egon's daughter not know who her father really was, let alone the grandkids? The kids are shown with YouTube and mobile phones, but we're expected to believe they are ignorant of how the world was saved from supernatural Armageddon, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria, not once but twice?

It was hard to believe that a prosecutor would go to trial without a shred of evidence, the whole trial consists on subjective opinions. Also the fact that the child was present to attend is not plausible, so isn't the way he is interviewed and the fact his subjective opinions are a factor in the trial.

During the entire film I felt tense, thinking something terrible would happen at any moment (especially when the dog almost dies), and I find it interesting that it didn't. It ends in a subjective way, leaving the expectador questioning what was presented, in a sense giving us the opportunity of ""choosing"" whether Sandra killed her husband.Now, my theory of what happened is that the husband didn't attempt suicide, but I also don't see any plausible reason for Sandra to suddenly decide to kill him, sure, there was that argument the day before he died, but I don't think it would've been enough (my inicial thoughts), but then in the end of the movie, when Sandra comes home and hugs her son, the look in his eyes felt like he knew something more, the way he kisses her head in a sense of protection. He also seemed sort of relieved his father had died, maybe his mother did in fact kill his father and he decided to protect her. There is a scene in which he is talking to Marge as if he had to make a choice, he didn't know if he believed his mother or not and he suddenly takes her side? Perhaps he concluded his mother had indeed killed the man, hinted by the time he wanted to be alone without his mom, and yet decided to support her side, because he was mad about how much his father made her suffer. I strongly believe that he invented that dialogue with his father in the car though.Overall I really enjoyed the movie, loved the way they used music to enhance the drama, but I do think it could've been a bit shorter, some parts at the court are very long and tough to keep focus, but it doesn't bother me so much.Plus, Sandra Huller's acting was impeccable, the whole cast, I think, had great performances which definitely made the movie even better."," Really enjoyed the movie (7.6)"

While it initially captivates with its compelling plot and immaculate acting, it ultimately collapses under the weight of its disappointing ending. As the story unfolds, it becomes apparent that the filmmakers missed a golden opportunity for a satisfying plot twist that would have elevated the narrative to new heights.I understand the cliffhanging moment and the opportunity for versatile interpretation of the main event, yet it is a shame that it felt substantially and visually unfinished.Some stories are better written on a page, and this is a prime example of that.

Moreover, almost all the characters in the film are unpleasant. Both the acting and the directing are extremely mediocre. In the film, I just feel unbearably sorry for the boy who finds himself in such a situation. And my God, the heroes are writers? Are you seriously? I advise authors to watch the film ""Adaptation"" from Charlie Kaufman, which satirizes cliches in cinema. Just as the main character stole the plot of the book from her husband, so the authors of this film stole the plot from other more worthy works. A shame! Doesn't deserve an Oscar!If you want to watch a really good drama in which a young woman faces the judicial system, moreover, based on real events, I recommend the South Korean film ""Way Back Home"" (2013) from the female director Bang Eun-jin."," It's corny"

I would like to focus more on the concept that it presents which is better said in the words of the son: ""When we don't understand how it happened, we should try to understand why it happened.""The film focuses on the impossibility of truth. Much like Schrodinger's cat, we don't know the reality of ""Schrodinger's Fall"" until we look in the box. The tricky part with truth though is that it is not a box in which we can look into, it happened once and cannot be seen again. Yes, we can delve into every nook and cranny of the story and it's elements but we can never know a hundred percent what it is.This aspect of the truth is masterfully exhibited in the trial where two or more interpretations fill in the same blank. Each is equally convincing and easy to disprove in a plethora of information and facts.There lies its true nature. It is deeply personal as, despite everything we observe (the ""How""), what we decide on depends in its core to a gut feeling (the ""Why""). What ""Why"" better fits the facts, is in the end our truth."," Anatomy of a fall"

This family seemingly bravely recovered from the pain and back to normal life, yet the scars had long been embedded in their hearts. The father's self-blame kept him entangled in guilt towards his son. He desired to devote all his time to him. As a writer, he struggled to let go of his writing, torn between his inner turmoil and commitment to his son.On the other hand, the mother, even braver, was not defeated by the pain. Her resilience led her writing back to its course. However, ironically, the mother's strength became the last straw that crushed the father.

"76","Anatomie d'une chute","PedroPires90","9/10","6 November 2023","If someone had told me that ""Anatomie d'une chute"" would make me add 50 Cent's ""P. I. M. P."" to my playlist, I probably wouldn't have known how to react. It was unexpected to see the presence of the theme in a French legal drama, and even more surprising was its prominence in addressing some of the film's central themes. But despite appearances, ""Anatomie d'une chute"" is anything but a typical dull legal drama.I admit that your experience with this film may vary depending on your level of engagement with the work, as your experience will be greatly affected by how much this film can draw you into its world, its characters, and their nuances. At its core is a mysterious death.There are various ways to approach this story. It could have been an investigative thriller in the style of David Fincher, but it's not. Justine Triet knows exactly what she wants to extract from it. She is more interested in showing it through the eyes of the people involved and does an astonishing job in this regard. Rather than the quest for the truth, the script is more concerned with how people react to the bits of information they come across. It also aims to demonstrate the complexity of human relationships and the path that leads to certain decisions in the lives of couples that can never be fully understood by an external audience filled with prejudices and snap judgments. The media attention surrounding the trial that occupies almost the entirety of the last two acts of this film demonstrates that the truth is not always the most important aspect. It also shows that the judgment of a specific moment or action is less significant for the audience than a character judgment that is always waiting to be passed.The way this is all filmed surprised me greatly. Triet doesn't seek a classical and comfortable approach. The blocking is phenomenal, making us feel almost like intruders. The camera's movements are also unstable, approaching the emotionally unstable characters. It's a mastery that few possess, not because few know how to do it technically, but because few can do it so effectively, eliciting the emotional response desired from the audience. For instance, there's a scene in which a third party speaks about the deceased. The camera first focuses on Daniel (Milo Machado Graner), the son, who is visibly uncomfortable but tries to hide it. Then it shifts to Sandra (Sandra H√ºller), and we can see the same discomfort in her as she tries to make eye contact with her son. It moved me and brought tears to my eyes. The foreground here wasn't the dialogue but how it was affecting these people.What Milo Machado Graner, one of the most impressive performances by a young actor, and especially Sandra H√ºller do in this film is sensational. H√ºller brings an impressive array of expressive tools that always work according to the moment when they are put into action. When she tries to seduce, when she fights, when she opens up, when she closes off, when she feels invincible, when she feels vulnerable. Her micro-expressions and body language convey everything she has to say, and I must say that I consider this performance among the best I've ever seen. It's spine-chilling.With this, I'm afraid I might be doing a disservice to the supporting actors, which would be unfair because they all deliver outstanding performances. In addition to the previously mentioned young actor, Swann Arlaud plays the eloquent defense lawyer and friend who becomes increasingly close to Sandra. Antoine Reinartz portrays a powerful prosecutor with a speech as intense as it is well-crafted. Samuel Theis shines in an incredible scene from the past. And speaking of that scene... what an immense kitchen argument, so well-crafted, packed with information, filled with conflicting emotions, repressed feelings, and expertly edited to the point where all you can do is open your mouth in admiration of such a work of art. After all, this film is about several falls, and no scene could better exemplify the most significant fall than that one.Although this is not the easiest film to watch, demanding a lot from the viewer, especially until the end of the first act, the way everything unfolds, the development of its script, and the paths and destinations of its thematic approach are absolutely fascinating. It is one of the most realistically human films in its approach to unknown facts. It doesn't aim for flashy cinematic spectacle, but it provides plenty to engage your gray matter every time you think about it.What happens inside each home is truly known only to those who live there. The truths. The half-truths. ""Anatomie d'une chute"" is a magnificent realistic exercise in the search for a truth that isn't always attainable, forcing everyone else to navigate in an uncertain but necessary zone of conscious decision-making. Sandra H√ºller delivers one of the best performances in history. Period. Chilling."," Chilling"

"78","Anatomie d'une chute","steiner-sam","9/10","28 October 2023","It's a legal drama set in the recent past in a chalet in the French Alps near Grenoble and a courtroom in Grenoble, France. It follows the investigation and trial of a female novelist charged with the death of her husband, also a novelist.Sandra Voyter (Sandra H√ºller) is a successful German novelist. While studying in Great Britain, she met her husband, Samuel Maleski (Samuel Theis), a French-background university lecturer and aspiring novelist. They have an 11-year-old son, Daniel (Milo Machado Graner), who suffered an injury at age four that seriously affected his eyesight. They have moved to Samuel's home community near Grenoble because he thought this would aid his writing. They speak English and French at home; Samuel doesn't speak German, and Sandra believes her French is not strong. Clearly, the marriage has been troubled since Daniel's accident, which took place in a traffic accident while Daniel was in Samuel's care.The movie opens with Sandra being interviewed by a graduate student, Zo√© Solidor (Camille Rutherford). Samuel is working in the chalet's attic, installing insulation and playing music louder and louder, forcing the interview to end. When Zo√© leaves, Daniel takes his dog, Snoop, for a walk. When he returns, he discovers Samuel dead on the ground after a fall from the third-floor attic. Sandra claims she was asleep until she heard Daniel's scream.The circumstances of Samuel's death launch an investigation. Did Samuel fall? Was he pushed? Did he jump? What caused his significant head wound? The authorities eventually charge Sandra with murder. Her lawyer, Vincent Renzi (Swann Arlaud), has an earlier history with Sandra and seems uncertain about his beliefs about her role. The trial does come to a believable conclusion.Sandra H√ºller and Milo Machado Graner give stunning performances. ""Anatomy of a Fall"" is one the best legal dramas I've seen for a long time. I can't speak to the accuracy of the French courtroom scenes; it's markedly different than North American and English courts in the wide-ranging manner of witness interrogation that involves the accused all along the way, and both the prosecutor and defense lawyers take great liberty to insert argument amid questioning. But the audience learns just a little more at each turn through the slow unfolding of Sandra's and Samuel's marriage through the testimony.If you like legal dramas, ""Anatomy of a Fall"" is highly recommended."," Sandra H√ºller and Milo Machado Graner give stunning performances"

When Samuel is found dead after a fall from the top of the house, Sandra finds herself hauled into court on suspicion of his murder. With Daniel as the only credible witness, he is kept apart from her, and plunged into a moral quandary over what he wants to tell the courts.Foreign cinema gets disturbingly little exposure over here, but this lengthy, award winning effort from writer/director Justine Triet has arrived on a non-streaming platform service. And luckily, it's worth the cash. And the time, given its over two and a half hour length. With a cast likely to be unfamiliar to uncultured swine who aren't familiar with a broader range of cinematic staples (such as moi), there's no one whose star power overshadows the proceedings, and so the whole experience can be soaked up in just the right way.Although it's a legal drama set in an unfamiliar climate, with a courtroom procedure that seems completely wild from the outside looking in (with cross examination seemingly mixed in with all kinds of other factors), there's still a searing sense of realism to it all, without the wild theatricality of your average cheesy Hollywood courtroom drama, real people with real emotions and real revelations pouring out in the courtroom. In the lead role, Huller lays everything on the line, unleashing the pent up frustrations of a wife who's kept everything in for years, but it's probably Machado-Graner who steals the show as the afflicted rich kid stuck in the middle in his own private hell.It all builds up to a genuinely suspenseful climax, where nothing is certain, and the trial will leave a tonne of emotional turmoil one way or the other.

"86","Anatomie d'une chute","arungeorge13","8/10","15 October 2023","The beauty of the film truly lies in how delicately it's paced throughout. Even when it takes the shape of a courtroom drama with great attention to detail, it still rests firmly on the emotional bonding between the lead characters - in this case, a mother (Sandra), her son (Daniel), and their dog. That never takes a backseat, despite the film turning into a murder mystery (of sorts) at several points. I absolutely loved the performances here, be it Sandra H√ºller, Swann Arlaud, Milo Machado Graner, and Samuel Theis. And for all it's worth, the standout here is Snoop (the dog), and his presence not only drives the story forward at a pivotal juncture, but this wonderful canine also takes the audience's perspective in the beginning and at the end of the film. He's travelling with these characters just like us, while also playing the role of an unconditional guardian angel to Daniel.When the writing digs deep into the intricacies of a marriage, it is poignant, relatable, and hard-hitting. Both the husband and the wife are writers essentially, and that makes their struggles and little victories all the more accessible. The changing dynamics in their relationship is brought to light through superbly shot flashbacks (just as their audio recordings are being played in court), and we as audiences, understand what each half of the couple is going through. The journey is dramatic alright, but since the outcome determines whether the mother gets to reunite with her son after a long, drawn-out trial, it always remains riveting to watch. The ""lesser"" moments - like a scene that depicts Sandra and her lawyer friend drinking together, are also beautifully staged."," A (crime?) drama of the finest quality! [+83%]"

More and more inconsistencies appear, so that the writer comes under increasing suspicion. And even feels compelled to call on a lawyer (Swann ARLAUD), whom she knows from before, to provide legal advice. Soon there will actually be a court hearing in nearby Grenoble, where hopefully all the uncertainties can be cleared up...Justine TRIET offers a lot in her film, which was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival: courtroom film, thriller, marital drama. However, all genre elements are essentially broken down into their components. Can the truth even be found like this? And weren't both married couples also accomplished writers or literary educators? The script that TRIET wrote together with her life partner Arthur HARARI also plays with this very cleverly. In German-speaking countries, the phenomenon of autofictional literature was only recognized with some delay. It was only the success of the Norwegian author Karl Ove KNAUSGARD that introduced German-speaking readers to a type of literature that has been very popular in France since Marguerite DURAS and Annie ERNAUX (NOBEL PRIZE for Literature 2022). Autofiction means that the author appears autobiographically in a fictional text. Actually a contradiction from which there is no escape for readers. Unless the text is received either autobiographically or fictionally. Both together don't work.In relation to the film's plot: What does it actually mean when a couple of writers autofictionally tear each other apart in their own relationship? Are conflicts then real or are they almost acted out in order to be able to exploit them in an autofictional way? And what happens to a child who is helpless in this struggle? However, these abstract questions are interwoven into an exciting plot that can rise above such background information. But that can be crucial for winning film awards. Just think of the year 1994, when a certain Quentin TARANTINO finally used the literary option of not having to tell a plot chronologically, which had been tried and tested since the turn of the century (i.e. Since 1900!!!), in a film with perfectly normal genre elements and It also rightly received the Palme d'Or in Cannes.A little fun fact on the side: screenwriter Arthur HARIRI has a cameo appearance in the film as a literary critic for a French television show.But all of this should not be defamed as too calculated! Justine TRIET delivered an outstanding film. The script by her and Arthur HARARI offers pure excitement and is at the same time literary satisfying. Someone has to do that first! Basically, this can only happen about every 30 years! And then Sandra H√úLLER! What more can you say about this exceptional actress? It takes the whole thing into another league. She already has the EUROPEAN FILM AWARD, a nomination for the ACADEMY AWARD should now be inevitable!!!P. S.: At P. I. M.

The film refuses to answer the question of guilt or innocence, but rather examines how people construct their own narratives based on partial and biased information. The film shows how gender, media, and personal motives influence the interpretation of the facts. The son of the accused, who is the only witness, admits that he does not know what really happened, and that he has to make a choice about what to believe. The prosecutor, who seems to have a personal vendetta against the accused, also relies on assumptions and speculations rather than solid evidence. The film is a compelling and nuanced study of human psychology and social dynamics. The film is well-acted and directed, but it could have been shorter. Some scenes in the courtroom are repetitive and drag on for too long."," A deep yet entertaining take on the courtroom drama"
"89","Anatomie d'une chute","mesaxi","6/10","25 December 2023","I was excited to see this movie because several people had recommended it, but I really didn't think it was all that good. Maybe I'm just too American to understand the French courts, but everything about the legal proceedings seemed ridiculous to me. Like suspicion even being cast on the wife without a shred of actual evidence, they simply say ""these bruises aren't what we'd expect, his wife must have killed him"". They badgered a child to get the results they want, taking his word as truth until he changed his mind and then their legal standing was ""no takesies-backsies"". The first witness is lead by the prosecutor like a dog to say the things he wanted, they read fiction literature in a court room as evidence to the authors character, people would just jump up and start cross-examining whenever they felt like it. If this is how it works in France, I'm mortified. When the movie hurt a dog to make a stupid point I started to check out, not only that but the court seemed to consider the ""dog experiment"" as actual evidence. The last 10 minute to me were the most confusing part. Like there was a perfect moment for an ending, I even said ""aaaaaand credits"" only to get 10 more minutes of.....? I don't really know what that ending was about, I kept waiting for some sort of reveal.Again, maybe I just don't get the French courts, but this movie seemed extremely unlikely and felt very frustrating. If you're into European court dramas I guess check it out, but I think this was kind of meh."," What's the big deal?"
"90","Anatomie d'une chute","MogwaiMovieReviews","6/10","16 December 2023","Watched this recent French film last night; the winner of this year's Palme d'Or, which says something about the level of competition in the world of film today.It's an excellently acted and well-shot story of a wife on trial for the possible murder of her husband, who is found fallen from the highest window of their alpine home, but at 2¬Ω hours, it's a good 40 or 50 minutes too long for such a small and relatively simple tale. There are endless courtroom scenes that don't progress the narrative or lead to any shocking twists, which could have easily been compressed or pared down in more competent hands.It's an extremely - and frustratingly - female film, in its wallowing in subjectivity and its repeated assertion that what one feels is actual reality, rather than the facts of the matter, and as a result, there is no clear ending to the film, the message being that you can choose to believe whatever the hell you like. But of course this is silly nonsense: either one human being pushed another human being out of a window or they didn't, and in a murder trial, that should be all that matters.So yes, it's a strange thing to rate: on a moment-by-moment basis, it's well-observed and often engrossing, but the substance of the story itself is flimsy and, in the final analysis, almost non-existent, so the most I can generously give it is 6/10."," A clumsy, overlong and frustratingly insubstantial film with good performances"
"91","Anatomie d'une chute","brentsbulletinboard","6/10","5 January 2024","It's always disappointing when a film aspires to greatness that it never achieves. Such is the case with the latest offering from French writer-director Justine Triet, whose allegedly suspenseful thriller is about as appetizing as a plate of tepid leftovers. This crime investigation/courtroom drama about the mysterious death of a middle-aged unsuccessful writer (Samuel Theis) who falls from the second story of his mountain chalet looks into whether his demise is due to suicide or murder, with his wife (Sandra H√ºller), herself a best-selling author, being the prime suspect. Despite an intriguing premise, however, the movie is overlong, needlessly talky and inherently flat, with a cold, clinical, unengaging narrative and characters who engender no connection, compassion or empathy. In essence, this is a ""whodunnit"" that plays like an extended ""whocares."" Fault the screenplay here, which seeks to tell a tale in the same gripping vein as such great courtroom dramas as ""Anatomy of a Murder"" (1959) but that never achieves the level of tension, mystery and audience engagement needed to pull that off. The meticulously orchestrated script feels calculated and derivative virtually from start to finish, especially in its trial sequences, which explore an array of possible motives and explanations, including everything from infidelity to plagiarism to previous suicide attempts, that rely on often-implausible speculation and inflated conjecture to carry forward a proceeding that probably never should have ended up in court in the first place. What's more, the double entendre that is the picture's title is so obvious that any hopes of nuance, subtlety or profundity evaporate quickly once the failing nature of the couple's troubled relationship surfaces. While the film admittedly features a fine performance by H√ºller, it's far from enough to rescue a picture with big aspirations that never pan out. How this release has garnered so much exaggerated awards season buzz is beyond me, especially given its intrinsically insipid, underwhelming, overstated character. There are plenty of other films of this ilk out there that are far more worth watching than this one, so grab one of those better selections instead and give this one the well-earned pass it genuinely deserves."," Flat, Boring, Talky and Overlong (Yawn)"

All thanks to a grippy screenplay and some terrific acts delivered by the whole ensemble, particularly Sandra H√ºller, she was fantastic."," Little bit underwhelming!"
"94","Anatomie d'une chute","olcare","9/10","5 November 2023","First of all, the movie was incredibly realistic. I haven't seen a film that felt this realistic in a long time, and it didn't oversimplify the complex situation. Additionally, the film was very well-directed, and the director's skill was evident.I won't delve deeply into the performances, but everyone did quite well. There might have been a couple of instances of overacting that caught my eye, but overall, the performances were on point.As I mentioned in the first paragraph, the direction really caught my attention. Apart from the screenplay, they portrayed events from a very accurate angle and profile, which was impressive. Another outstanding aspect was the courtroom scenes, with long, uncut takes that were mesmerizing in terms of both acting and cinematography, creating a sense of realism that truly captivated me. I couldn't believe how real it was. It was even more real than reality, to put it that way.The screenplay was clear and straightforward, with no exaggeration. However, I can offer some criticism towards the end, as the runtime extended, and as the conclusion began to take shape, I started to feel fatigued as a viewer. This is where I deducted some points, as I had expected 1-2 unique scenes that were missing.I'd like to mention my favorite scenes in the film with spoilers. The scene where the Snoop is poisoned was amazing; it made me feel so bad that my stomach still hurts, and that's a serious achievement. Daniel's final speech where he talks about the memory and his facial expressions were incredibly well done. I applaud the young actor. Sandra H√ºller's performance in the scene where she argues with her husband was excellent, and her monologue was spot on. I also loved the part where the events were simulated; it was my favorite part, as it set this film apart from others.Additionally, during the courtroom scenes in the film, there is a lot of back and forth, which is hard to describe. The film explores all possibilities but doesn't lead you to a definite conclusion by the end. I'm not sure whether Daniel's final memory he shares in court is real or if it indicates that he couldn't accept that his mother was the murderer. If the events in the film had been resolved to my satisfaction, I wouldn't have liked it as much. I don't know what the general consensus is, but I believe that each possibility remains equally plausible from the start, and this aspect of the film is one of its strong points.In summary, despite the weariness towards the end, I'm glad I watched it in the cinema, and I'm glad I went to see this French production. It's the right kind of film in every aspect."," I'm lucky to have seen it in the cinema"

After all the hype and awards, this was a huge disappointment. Where do I start?1. It's a 2.5 hours courtroom drama that leads to absolutely nowhere. I was waiting for a twist - even a punch line - and it never came. The ending was a huge letdown and made the entire movie pointless2. The movie was way too slow and long, they should have cut at least 30 minutes3. There were several sudden camera corrections/shakes/zooms that were obviously not intended for the final edit but were left in the movie anyway for no apparent reason.

Perhaps they do things differently there but I'm not aware of any courtroom in which you can cross-examine more than one person at the same time and just ask anybody what you want at any time, it's ridiculous. Not to mention that people talked about speculations and other people's feelings and intentions without any of the lawyers objecting.

His wife, who was the only other occupant of the chalet at the time, is the prime suspect and is indicted. The only witness is their blind young son. At the trial all manner of secrets of the couple's relationship are revealed.Just when I was despairing at the state of modern cinema, this film comes along. Absolutely superb, building a story solidly, sensitively, intelligently and without treating the audience as idiots.While the film is predominantly a courtroom drama and much of the information in the film is revealed through the courtroom scenes, it is much more than that. There's a mystery element to it - what really happened? - but there's also a large human drama aspect to the film. Mostly through the court testimonies and questioning we get to see the dynamic between the husband and wife, the events that have shaped their relationship and the role their son plays in the dynamic. It's highly engaging storytelling.Throw in an allusion to Otto Preminger's 1959 masterpiece ""Anatomy of a Murder"" and some wonderfully ambiguous plot developments and you have a film that manages to cleverly manipulate its audience without being overly complex and disengaging. So deft are the touches it manages to feel totally complete without ever fully laying its cards on the table.Writer-director Justine Triet and co-writer Arthur Harari deservedly won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. The film had four other Oscar nominations, including for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actress.On the subject of performances, while Sandra Huller deserved her Oscar nomination, Messi the dog really deserved some sort of special award for his performance.

"102","Love Lies Bleeding","diogomend","3/10","24 March 2024","""Love Lies Bleeding"" is a cinematic journey that polarizes its audience from the get-go, embarking on a controversial portrayal of gender dynamics that leaves much to be desired. The film categorically paints all of its male characters in an evil light, portraying them predominantly as either women beaters or women killers. On the other hand, women share a true love that nobody could break, even if they have only met for a couple of days.The film attempts to justify this narrative through an over-reliance on prolonged sexual scenes, aiming to shock its viewers. However, these scenes fall flat, lacking the intended impact and coming across as slightly cringe.As the plot meanders into its second act, there's a glimpse of intrigue that briefly captures the audience's attention, suggesting a potential redemption for the narrative. Yet, this hope is swiftly dashed as the movie descends into a chaotic finale that defies logic and reason.

Or so was I led to believe from that 7.5 IMDB rating. Not my cup of tea after all, oh well.. The director did a poor job at developing his characters. Fine, Ed Harris is a bad guy, but what is it that makes him so? The score was terrible too. The focus was on creating some form of tension midway through the movie through eerie, stringy tones, but it gets old and boring after a while. I guess the movie poster is to blame somewhere.

"104","Love Lies Bleeding","Anna_Brassky","6/10","28 March 2024","Love Lies Bleeding is the second movie by the director Rose Glass, starring Kristen Stewart.The 1980s. A young girl, Lou (Stewart), works as a manager at a gym and desperately tries to quit smoking. One day, a muscular beauty Jackie who dreams of winning a bodybuilding competition enters the gym. The girls start an affair. But Lou's family story is a complicated one. Her father is an arms dealer, and her sister regular gets beaten by her husband. Things aren't easy for Jackie either. To increase her chances in competitions, she starts using steroids, and those have unpleasant side effects, which will kick off this bleeding story...I think many of you have already got used to the idea that Stewart has long migrated from being a blockbuster actress to an independent film actress, and this movie is no exception.Rose Glass is obviously talented, but as it often happens with aspiring ones, they inadvertently begin to copy the style of the directors who've already said their word in cinematography. And in this case, I found myself watching a skillful imitation of Nicolas Winding Refn. But even though Refn's films are also full of sex and blood, he handles these vivid plot elements with incredible aesthetics, weaving them logically into the fabric of the plot.This cannot be said about Rose's work, although stylistically it is a twin to The Neon Demon or Too Old to Die Young.In general, LLB could have a good chance of becoming something truly memorable:
Great cast. The title girls are organic and natural. Stewart, as usual, looks convincing and impressive even with the most idiotic haircut and greasy hair. Katy O'Brien, who plays her bodybuilder girlfriend, is strikingly beautiful and athletic. Jena Malone (Refn's favorite, by the way), Ed Harris, Dave Franco. Everything's great, but no magic. Why?Because the director decided to address a huge number of themes at once: female bodybuilding, steroids, domestic violence, love, and the problem of fathers and children, but none of them was thoroughly developed. At the same time, she found time to include scenes that don't contribute to the narrative and seem to be added just to shock the viewer. Like in the intro, where Stewart's character digs into a clogged gym toilet and pulls out excrement.According to my observations, female directors tend to have a more nuanced and refined view of their characters. They look deep into characters' minds and souls and reveal the full range of their emotions to the audience. In movies like this, the plot supports the emotion instead of leading it. Rose Glass, however, lost on both sides. In pursuit of shock content, she gave up on, probably, the most important ingredient. The heart.

Each character had a stake in this story that elevated the drama. The acting was well done and each character felt unique with their own personalities and concerns.There were some stylistic decisions made in this film that felt out of place. For instance, the character Jackie (Katy O'Brian) is using steroids in the film and there are sequences that make it seem like she will transform into she-hulk at any minute. This often took away from the tone of the film giving it more of a comedic feel oppose to the serious nature that these scenes were conveying. It was really weird that this is how the film maker decided to show that she was dealing with roid rage. I enjoyed her performance but would have liked a deeper exploration into her character outside of being this nomadic body builder.However, this simplicity worked much better for other characters such as JJ (Dave Franco), Daisy (Anna Baryshnikov) and Beth (Jena Malone). Ed Harris' character and that of Kristen Stewart were probably the most developed.The involvement of the F. B. I. In this story was a bit shallow. More involvement from this agency could have made this crime film more interesting. Despite that the action and drama in this film did keep me interested despite the conclusion being rather predictable and cliche.The graphic nudity in this film was very annoying as it was excessive and without true purpose.The hyper-sexualization in films needs to stop as it often never adds anything of significance towards the plot. There are simpler ways to suggest these sexual acts are being had without making the audience feel uncomfortable.These scenes felt forced into the story perhaps to demonstrate how attracted these characters were to each other.

It was me and two other people. By the end of the movie we were all friends. It was a good experience. All and all was not a bad experience. To see it again in theaters no, but wouldn't mind catching it again on Netflix or any other platform. Once it's streamable. I recommend it.I am going to start watching more movies directed by Rose Glass. Was very impressed with this one."," I love the concept and the movie until the end"
"114","Love Lies Bleeding","SAMTHEBESTEST","4/10","3 April 2024","Love Lies Bleeding (2024) :
Movie Review:Love Lies Bleeding Review: Back in the early 30s, there was a pre-code era. The movie code changed again in the early 80s, giving full freedom to the filmmakers to go all out with their wild content, and then we got a new ""ratings"" system. In today's time, it's quite easy to make sexually explicit movies, even without straight-gender affairs. Sometimes it helps the filmmakers to get a soft corner from critics and audiences for the gutsy content and severe presentation. Love Lies Bleeding has it all-wild romance of lesbians, sexually stimulating scenes, revenge theories, and uncompromised physical presentation-but has it got a storyline to match all these things? The answer is a big NO. A sensible romance like ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" comes once in a while to teach lessons to all the filmmakers on ""how it's done."" Love Lies Bleeding has no context to cover its bisexual and lesbian theories, further weakened by a ridiculously fantasized climax.Set in the late 19th century, Love Lies Bleeding tells the story of a reclusive gym manager, Lou (Kristen Stewart), who is part of a crime family. Her relationship with her father is only for a name, since she has abandoned him owing to some past trauma related to her mother. Daisy (Anna Baryshnikov) has a crush on Lou and even dares to make sexual advances towards her, but all in vain. Lou then starts fancying an ambitious bodybuilder, Jackie (Katy O'Brian), who is soon going to participate in a bodybuilding competition in Vagas. In their first meeting, they come close and begin a strong sexual and romantic relationship. During this period, Katy becomes emotionally attached to Lou's problems, one of which is her sister's brutal and violent husband. Interestingly, Katy had a paid sexual encounter with that man before meeting Lou. When Lou is upset and angry about him beating her sister, Katy takes a bold step to make things ""right,"" leading both of them into a jam. Will they be able to get out of it and keep their relationship intact?Rose Glass and Weronika Tofilska's script has some sexually arousing moments in the first half, many of which will be censored in India. It's some different kind of fun to watch all this erotic drama with such characters-one with handsome muscular physics and another one with a standard female body. The conversions about ""using fingers"" and ""bisexuality"" sound too bold for the film set in the 1890s. Yet we have to go along just to please the hidden, lusty side in all of us. However, the second half goes too bad, too rubbish to be passed on. That entire crime angle-killings, psychological trauma, revenge, and redemption-don't make no sense. Katy suddenly grows to be an enormous beast-a scene that would perfectly fit a werewolf movie, and mind you, this wasn't it. A trained cop can miss easy shots on Lou, but she, without seeing the target, would hit it right. Daisy's suspense in the last scene will force you to laugh at the writers' maturity. So, there is a whole bag of problems that makes this film a big mess, and I wouldn't overlook any of them.Kristen Stewart has gone wild in this erotic thriller, which was required for the context. Her physical appearance and expressions speak a lot, even though dialogues fail to make any impression. Katy O'Brian's muscular body will have many drooling (of those sexes) over her, but let me tell you something about the performance that has come unexpectedly. In that ramp scene, her expressions were on-point. One can feel that pain, even though the scene is spoiled by illogical trauma, which turns into vomiting. Ed Harris surprises with his uncanny appearance and that good-for-nobody attitude. ""You don't know anything about love,"" says Jena Malone, Lou's sister, and we all feel pity for her. Not because she actually loved her husband, but because she looked so dumb there. Anna Baryshnikov actually looked cute and beautiful, while Dave Franco was fairly good in his small role.Ben Fordesman's camerawork was revealing in those closeups of intimate scenes, while the background score felt too loud sometimes. Clint Mansell's music found some suitable tunes for those particular scenes and times. The editing by Mark Towns keeps you hooked, despite the flawed climax. Coming after that sweet little film, Saint Maud (2019), Rose Glass attempts to break some glasses here but only makes noise; no impact. Love Lies Bleeding could be seen as an erotic thriller, but the sexual segments aren't really connected to what goes wrong here. It battles to find its identity as a romantic thriller and finds some reasons to make us believe in it, but then it again loses steam by the river's end. The climax is a major fallout here and plays a big spoilsport. Rose could have written a better and more believable story than this utterly messy erotic-romance-revenge-thriller-fantasy-sports-drama and what else she only knows. As a whole, I can say that Love Lies Bleeding lies low.RATING - 4/10*"," A Sexually Revolting Romantic Thriller With No Context"
"115","Love Lies Bleeding","jfecher-46151","10/10","15 March 2024","Love Lies Bleeding was awesome. One of my favorites of the year so far! 4/5!Rose Glass is becoming a favorite director of mine pretty quickly! This film combined so many elements and genres from thriller, romance, drama, horror, comedy and much more. It also felt body horror-esk. Throughly enjoyed the acting as I'm not *always* a fan of Kristen Stewart. However, I really enjoyed her and the rest of the talented cast in this film. Some of the so called ""non-reality"" scenes were epic. The storyline was simple enough yet thrilling and shocking at times!Great watch. Well done to Rose Glass on her second feature! I hope she keeps up the excellent work."," Love lies bleeding!!"

Without an obvious message - girl power, girl boss, or some other superficial sh...stuff.It is an essence of entertainment for me. This is the reason, I still watch movies sometimes. This is relatable and this is not cringe. It is what it is, without forcing itself on you. Plot is simple, plot is fun. Revenge is SATISFYING. It is a body I admire, it is a body I prefer, it is a body I love.I didn't quite get the fantastical moments, but I guess it made sense from a perspective I failed to see.

Well, it seems like it's rigged in favor of anyone who happens to be of the fairer sex, can hold a camera in their hands and yell ""action.""C'mon everyone, are we serious? The protagonist turns into The Incredible Hulk after 2 hours of grotesque violence, graphic sex with no heart, and vapid dialogue, that would make even Mr. Rogers cringe.What has happened to film over the past three years? Politics full stop.I don't usually have such visceral reactions to films this intensely, but Love Lies Bleeding is by far one of the worst I've seen in my entire life. Full stop, it caters to a warped idealogy that tears down the expression of true art. I've seen lifetime movies better than this empty plot.Now, the ""auteur"" here is no Kathryn Bigelow. Glass has nothing to say. The dialogue was contrived and profane for no reason. Soapy even. The protagonist was very unlikable. The sex scenes did nothing to entice me to keep watching. Ed Harris' character was cartoonish at best. It was a 2 hour weird for weird sake film that holds no social significance other than to scream ""I am an angry female who can kill men, hear me roar! Blue is the Warmest Color (a fabulous film I might add) it was not!Finally, what stands out as the worst part of this film is that it tries to be daring when in reality we've seen the same empty nonsense in other female driven screenplays: Saltburn, Nomadland etc. Characters with little to no personality. Man-hating female leads. Again, no imagination."," Empty Drivel"
"118","Love Lies Bleeding","njrmbm","6/10","22 March 2024","Just saw this today. There were a couple of fantastical steroid induced fever dream moments I wish hadn't been there, as I felt they took me out of such a dark and serious thriller, but generally an entertaining movie. Kristen Stewart has come a long way since the Twilight saga. She's proven many times over to be a talented actress. Haven't seen Ed Harris in quite a while. He's one of those actors you could hand a shopping list to and be entertained. A few cool flashbacks soaked in red light didn't hurt the film at all, but as mentioned, a few of the steroid moments went too far for me. Still, I mostly enjoyed this. If you like thrillers, check it out."," A Steroid Injected Thriller"
"119","Love Lies Bleeding","renohuskies","8/10","23 March 2024","""Love, Lies, and Bleeding"" is a standout film that grips you with its intense narrative and stellar performances. Kristen Stewart leads the cast with a powerful presence, but Ed Harris steals the show. His portrayal is so captivating that it's easy to imagine him as the perfect Cryptkeeper in a ""Tales of the Crypt"" reboot, should it ever come to fruition. The film weaves a complex tapestry of emotions, with each character's journey deeply intertwined with the others, creating a cinematic experience that's both thrilling and thought-provoking.

"120","Love Lies Bleeding","Beheezma","10/10","16 March 2024","I rarely feel compelled to review movies on here, but Love Lies Bleeding kicks ass. It's so well crafted from the look, sound and music to the writing, directing and performances. It's got the right balance of fantastical elements while remaining extremely grounded and concise. The central romance is both endearing and horrifying in a way that is real even when absurd. The movie encourages you to question and challenge all of its characters with refreshing, delightful and surprising plot evolutions. It is beautifully devoid of unnecessary exposition and background. It gives you exactly what you need to know and this is at a time when a lot of movies are obsessed with making obvious and trite statements rather than exploring raw emotion and feeling. It is gut-wrenching as well as heartwarming. Brutal and sincere. Some say ""It takes swings that don't always hit"". Those people fail to reconcile that this movie isn't made to please your morals or expectations or reality. This movie doesn't take swings. It just is what it is. It begins and ends with the characters and in that sense it never takes a wrong step or veers off-course of its main idea. It is a complex story about complicated people in even more complicated circumstances and it is executed with style, wit and charm. Love, sex, lust, greed, violence and hatred. It's all messy. As a thriller, comedy, drama... however you want to describe it... Love Lies Bleeding is the real deal. Authentic filmmaking and storytelling. What a thrill."," True Genre Filmmaking"
"121","Love Lies Bleeding","stevencayer","9/10","20 March 2024","Director Rose Glass has made two feature-length movies in her career so far, and I saw both of them today. Back in 2019, she wrote and directed SAINT MAUD, a psychological horror about a nurse dealing with PTSD and an obsession with religion. It blew my mind with its technical creativity and unsettling atmosphere and tone. I can't believe I missed this one until now. I'm not here to review this however. Her newest film is LOVE LIES BLEEDING, an erotic, gritty, crime thriller taking place in 1989 (yes, there is a mullet). Lou (Kristen Stewart) is a gym manager who doesn't mind getting her hands dirty (from scrubbing toilets of course). She quickly falls for Jackie (Katy O'Brian), a bodybuilder on her way to fulfill her dream in Vegas. Their chemistry is undeniable, but outside forces threaten to disrupt their bliss. The acting is amazing from everyone. It's my favourite role for Stewart. It took me a while to figure out that I saw and loved O'Brian in both The Mandalorian series and the newest ANTMAN movie. Also great are Ed Harris, Dave Franco, Jena Malone, and especially Anna Baryshnikov. This movie is like a jigsaw puzzle where each piece is a different character, portraying different kinds of love or obsession. Some pieces fit perfectly together. Some have been forced together but it looks like they fit. Some fit, but something doesn't look right. Love is different for everyone. The pace is like a rollercoaster ride; It slowly builds, rising higher and higher, you know the stuff's about to hit the fan, then you're suddenly going down, hanging on for dear life. You're defying gravity, it's out of control! Some people can't take it. Finally, you become grounded again at the end of the ride, breathlessly asking yourself ""Did that just happen?"" At least that's how I felt with LOVE LIES BLEEDING. I have to say, there's a scene near the end that will polarize people. It's weird and I loved it. Highly recommend this erotic acid trip of a movie, and I can't wait to see what Rose Glass does next. This is yet another hit from my favourite production company, A24. Remember, ""No one sees what they don't want to."""," an erotic rollercoaster ride on acid"
"122","Love Lies Bleeding","codyfernfan","8/10","17 March 2024","This movie has a great mix of gore, sex appeal, LGBT representation, some comedic/ironic/""badass"" elements and portrayal of government corruption. The scenery of this film, which is authentically in New Mexico, is rogue but stunning. I didn't even know that Kristen Stewart would be in this (I didn't watch the trailer), but I think she's really suited for this kind of role. Her natural obliviousness coincides with her character's history of exhaustion and complacency amidst her chaotic familial and environmental challenges. Lou's father is brilliantly terrifying, a realistic depiction of the characters found in the modern day ""wild West"". The main actress shines in her versatile depiction of a lively queer woman of color struggling with the causes and effects of her bodybuilding and PED use. Well done!"," Thrilling, clever & sapphic"
"123","Love Lies Bleeding","malmevik77","5/10","22 March 2024","Love Lies BleedingLove Lies Bleeding features Lou, Kristen Stewart, working in a gym, in 1989.

Jackie and Lou begin an affair and Lou introduces Jackie to steroids to help her physique. Unbeknownst to Lou, Jackie starts working at her estranged father's gun range, which gets Lou to start slowly opening up about her situation.Then... the movie goes insane. A romantic drama suddenly transforms into a crime thriller where secret after secret is revealed. Including the steroids, in the plot, basically throws lit dynamite at a gas station built over a gunpowder factory.It gets so ridiculous, the handful of people in the theater kept laughing at parts that weren't meant to be funny. It gets surreal, and complicated, and violent. Be warned.It took awhile to get the plot moving. I think this would have been better as a miniseries on tv. Also, one of the scariest parts of this movie is Ed Harris's hair. For the crazy parts in the last third of the movie, I was there for it.

"124","Love Lies Bleeding","breathedirt","1/10","23 March 2024","Abysmal sound effects and visual make-up, empty script for hollow and/or confused spectators and, of course, masculine ""women"" to slowly get people immune to it. I believe there is no need to say that this movie is just another proof that the De Ville has captured the holy wood. Both actresses were (intentionally) made physically unpleasant to look at but that is perhaps because there was very little femininity infused in them. Unless you like to eat alphabet soup, then you will not find much in this movie as normal people want to watch movies to see great acting and great meaningful story or get a great laugh and there was none of it in this movie. If the main point of your story is just someone's superficial attachment and confusion for the sake of forcing it down our throats then you will undoubtedly please the De Ville's holy wood but not the actual audience. As can be seen from the reviews here, they are not from normal people and/or are not unbiased. There was no true ""female power"" there, the only pulsating thing there was my vein from the sudden high blood pressure - just two tomboys being confused and focusing on unimportant things. Don't watch this movie if you have any brain cells left. Also, look at the actual reviews and not the ""weighted"" reviews. Some are scared of people hearing the truth so censorship and ""adjustments"" are necessary to keep the narrative alive."," A movie strong-arming the audience to accept stuff"

"126","Love Lies Bleeding","steveinadelaide","7/10","23 March 2024","Rose Glass, the visionary director behind Saint Maud, throws another punch with Love Lies Bleeding, a neo-noir crime thriller that's both stylish and unsettling. Lou, a cautious gym manager, has her world turned upside down when she develops feelings for Jackie, a dedicated bodybuilder in Las Vegas training for a competition (Katie O'Brian). Sparks fly, but their budding romance gets entangled with Lou's dark family secrets, propelling them down a violent path.Love Lies Bleeding isn't afraid to push boundaries. It evokes memories of classic thrillers like Body Double, with its neon-drenched aesthetic and underlying themes of obsession and desire. However, Glass injects a contemporary dose of female empowerment, subverting the stereotypical femme fatale trope. Jackie isn't just a damsel in distress; she's a complex character with her own agency, which adds a layer of intrigue to the narrative.The film's greatest strength lies in its central performances. Stewart delivers a raw and intense portrayal of Lou, a woman yearning for connection but burdened by her past. O'Brian matches her intensity, embodying the steely determination and vulnerability of Jackie with remarkable nuance. Their chemistry is undeniable, making us invested in their tumultuous relationship, even as things spiral out of control.While the plot takes some wild turns, it's the film's thematic exploration that lingers. Glass dissects the destructive nature of desire, and the lengths people go to in the name of love-or perhaps, obsession. The violence, though brutal, feels purposeful, serving as a metaphor for the emotional turmoil the characters endure.Admittedly, the pacing can be uneven at times. The first act establishes the characters and their connection beautifully, but the middle section drags a bit as the focus shifts towards the criminal underbelly. However, the film regains its momentum in the final act, culminating in a climax that's both shocking and strangely cathartic.Technically, Love Lies Bleeding is a knockout. The cinematography is sharp, using bold colours and contrasting lighting to create a visually arresting world. The pounding score complements the film's intensity, while the editing keeps the narrative taut without sacrificing character development.Love Lies Bleeding isn't for the faint of heart. It's a film that revels in its own darkness, challenging us with its graphic violence and unconventional love story. But for those seeking a neo-noir experience that's both thrilling and thought-provoking, this is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll.Love Lies Bleeding is a film with flaws, but its bold direction, phenomenal performances, and exploration of complex themes make it a worthwhile watch, especially for fans of unconventional thrillers. Just be prepared for a wild ride."," A love that bleeds"
"127","Love Lies Bleeding","AfricanBro","7/10","16 March 2024","My first thought was it feels like the gym was depicted in the way someone who doesn't go to the gym imagines the gym is like. Like they watched Pumping Iron instead of visiting the nearest gym. It's like if Pumping Iron was a raunchy, lesbian, blood-soaked psychedelic experience. With a dash of crime family drama.I found the cinematography of the movies to be quite impressive; it had a captivating aesthetic. Although it's not on an epic scale and mostly unfolds in remote settings, it's mesmerizingly filmed with themes of sex and violence. The characters are pretty good, so were the actors playing them. Kristen Stewart was Kristen Stewart, I think you already know what to expect when you see her in a movie, and I think she was pretty good. It took me a while to realize I recognized Katy O'Brian from The Mandalorian. I loved that she was homeless but still working out; if she can get swole living under a bridge, what's your excuse? Lol.Theres a huge emphasis on smoking and drugs, it's a pretty big theme and mostly referenced on the radio. The story is alright, there's a love, crime and family drama.It's quite raunchy. I wasn't expecting that, but I suppose the movie did give off those vibes. I just didn't watch any trailers or anything and went in blind. It also included some other adult/mature content like domestic violence. It's quite gory as well. Initially, it felt like it was penned by a man; I was surprised to learn it was written/directed by a woman afterward. I recall thinking that there will probably be a lot of people commenting on this, expressing their displeasure with how women are portrayed in movies written by men.The movie had several moments where I thought to myself, well that's taken a weird turn. It gets more weird and weirder the longer in goes. It's really weird that it was common/normal back then to just hit your wife. It was jarring to watch. Franco's character is probably the worst one.It's also one of those movies where none of the characters are good people, it's just bad people making bad decisions, in the name of love. I didn't really find myself rooting for anyone and l didn't feel particularly attached to the movie as a whole. I feel like it could've been better, and by better I mean more psychedelic, more violent, maybe even disturbing. It's not a movie for everyone, but it's pretty interesting and I enjoyed it. I like it but I don't know if it'll still be on my mind a month from now."," Mesmerizing to watch."
"128","Love Lies Bleeding","filmtravel101","5/10","17 March 2024","This is one of those type of films that is going to be very controversial as it is a director that has loads of talent yet the script writing is just not up to par.The acting is very good by all leads with some supporting cast that are marginal but the cinematography and scenes plus music is captivating enough to keep you intrigued. The chemistry between leads are realistic and the lesbian element is not noticeable enough to distract as there is a lot going on in this film.However the finale is just plain absurd almost borderline bad bizarre like it belongs to another film. It's unfortunate as there was so much wonderful suspense but it went in a direction that was laughable where most in the theatre gasped at the ludicrous image of an Attack of the 50' Giant Steroid Women. Yes it's that kinda crazy so be prepared for a wild ride that's campy and rare to see these days yet not everyone's cup of tea either. I'm looking forward to next film from this director and would like to see her direct someone else script as she reminds one of Refn N - Demon type filmmaker in the rough.5 stars for Stewart and Malone - but it could have been a 8-9 if not for silly ending."," Trippy story that borderlines on surreal then stupid finale"

She comes across a young female employee at a gym whom she quickly connects with, but who turns out to be at odds with her family, a hive of degenerates. Their romance ends up being intertwined in a web of crime.Kristen Stewart is quite good in this as the black sheep of the family and a determined rebel. Katy O'Brian turns out to be the unexpected life blood of this film. Her performance is so multidimensional that the film just wouldn't be as good without her. She conveys curiosity, fear, rage and ultimately ecstasy in the arms of her newfound muse. Her discovery of steroids adds a nice bonus, but it's possible this plot thread merely unleashed a fierce beast that was always there and never had a escape valve. Dave Franco is well-deployed in a brief but seething role as a scummy hooligan. Ed Harris is effectively cold-hearted as the local kingpin who seemingly owns everything in the town and has local law enforcement in his back pocket to cover up his dirty tracks.Although profoundly gripping and impossible to tune out, this is definitely not for squeamish viewers. The violence here is quite ferocious. The tension is at times a turbo-charged level. It's been a while since a film filled me with some of that old school dread as it drew toward its climax. The soundtrack often lean on soothing New Wave beats, as if to provide some relief from the devilish storyline. At times disturbing, other times intensely atmospheric, this film offers an escape from mainstream fare. Through it all, the ending feels hard-earned and cathartic.

"131","Love Lies Bleeding","ferguson-6","7/10","13 March 2024","Greetings again from the darkness. The first feature film from writer-director Rose Glass was delayed almost two years due to COVID, but when SAINT MAUD hit in 2021, we knew immediately she was a filmmaker to watch. Along comes her second feature, co-written with Weronika Tofilska, and as a rare lesbian neo-noir, it's sexy and violent and stylishly filmed ... confirming Glass as one to follow.To ensure that every viewer knows that glitz and glamour will not be featured, we are introduced to Lou (Kisten Stewart) as her gloved hand is elbow deep in a clogged toilet at the gym she manages. The gym is filled with sweaty bodies pumping iron, and Lou looks on mostly disinterested, save for gym rat Daisy (Anna Baryshnikov, Misha's daughter) who is obsessed with Lou thanks to their previous amorous interactions. Though Daisy is smitten, Lou is clearly disinterested, while being as nice as possible. As one lonely heart looking for love, Lou's eyes light up when she spots drifter Jackie (Katy O'Brian, ""The Mandalorian"") working out one evening. Jackie is making her way to Las Vegas to compete in a bodybuilding competition, and she and Lou hit it off that first night.The film is set in the late 1980's in some nowhere town in New Mexico, where nefarious doings are the only path to survival. In fact, the most nefarious of the bunch is Lou's father, Lou Sr (Ed Harris). Sporting shoulder length hair that gives him a ""Tales from the Crypt"" aura, Lou Sr runs a shooting range, while also running guns across the border, and in an unusual choice for a hobby, he collects live bugs. As the local crime lord, Lou Sr has a favorite spot for dumping the bodies of those who cross him.One other local scumbag on display here is JJ (Dave Franco), husband to Lou's sister Beth (the great Jena Malone). JJ is a world class wife-beater and the source of much angst for Lou ... this despite Beth's constant willingness to forgive her husband, due to her fear of being alone. JJ is the lowest form of life, and when he puts Beth in the hospital, it sends Lou into emotional turmoil, which in turn forces her new lover Jackie to turn She-Hulk, and flash the dark side from her past.Just about anything that can go wrong for these folks, does. It's an endless stream of bad luck, bad decisions, and just plain bad; however, it's mesmerizing to watch. We see a four-way battle: guns versus muscles versus love versus inner-strength. Some characters get what they deserve, while others just wallow in the mess. Daisy shows she is not as ditzy as she seems once she gains leverage, yet she also proves she's not as clever as she thinks.The performances here are quite fun to watch - Stewart, (especially) O'Brian, Harris, Baryshnikov, and Malone are all superb, and bring heft to an already creative and heavy-duty story. The score from Clint Mansell is a perfect fit, and Rose Glass's film bears a slight tonal resemblance to the Coen Brothers' classic BLOOD SIMPLE (1984). As in that one, the characters here often zig when we assume they will zag, and though the final act likely jumps the shark for some viewers, there is so much good here, that it prepares us for Glass's future visions.In theaters beginning March 15, 2024."," another gem from Rose Glass"

What was my surprise when I discovered a real movie.Love Lies Bleeding is one of those movies that catches you from the beginning and never lets you go. Is the filmmaking style a bit excessive? Yes. Sometimes almost inelegant? Yes. It uses a few too many tricks a little too frequently. But the result remains captivating, diving into the world of female body builders while mixing film genres and cinematographic styles, to create a unique film. One that, by the way, is genuinely feminist and lgbtq in an original and authentic way.Kirsten Stewart is outstanding, confirming her as one of the greatest talents in Hollywood today."," Wonderfully surprising"

As someone who typically gets annoyed by movies that attempt this over the last decade now, I would say it wasn't overwhelming or assertive at all. Straight forward plot, but never getting too predictable. It does a wonderful job of showing fresh exciting love being deconstructed by the realities of life very well.It was also the perfect length. It never feels like it's dragging on or being rushed.Acting was above average for today's standards. Nobodies acting got in the way of the plot.

Kristen is the daughter of Ed, who owns several businesses, including a gym that Kristen manages. Kristen and Ed do not get along because of Kristen's mother, who disappeared 12 years ago-Kristen thinks Ed had something to do with her leaving. Dave is married to Kristen's sister and is an abusive husband. Katy is passing through town on her way to a bodybuilding competition in Las Vegas and gets a job at one of Ed's other businesses, a gun shooting range. Katy and Kristen-who is a lesbian-get together. It seems that Katy likes men & women, and decides to help Kristen out by taking care of Dave, as a favor-remember, Dave is abusive-but takes it too far. Secrets are uncovered, as the police close in and things get a little weird at the end.It's rated R for violence, grisly images, language, drug use and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you are into bodybuilding, it would be alright to stream."," Thelma & Louise On Steroids"
"135","Love Lies Bleeding","statuskuo","4/10","18 March 2024","There are movies out there where after watching you read their praises and wondered if their cinema started in 2023. This is the public for you.Does anyone remember ""Bound""? A better lesbian noir that was so razor sharp it made you literally sit at the edge of your seat. There's odd tonal shifts too. I feel it's suppose to be a dark comedy. Maybe. In some places. God, who knows?!This movie was a mess. A cheap knockoff mess at that. A female bodybuilder hustler slips into town and gets the eye of a gym manager. They have an affair. After justifiably killing an important man they are tossed into damage control when one of the girl's father, a town gunrunning criminal, gets involved.Sounds juicy.However, director, Rose Glass seems to want to shoehorn this love story between these two. The problem is that their ""love"" is based on debaucherous lifestyle. You see how it would paint their relationship as failing? Also, I found nothing empathetic about either of the two. Kristen Stewart's Father, played by Ed Harris, is a bad guy. But the backstory is so muddled, and unfocused it's hard to determine if Kristen is the villain or he is. Yes, he looks every bit like the bad guy. And acts as such. But he still seems to be missing scenes where he is the the bad dude. I guess having one of your daughters marry a jerk (James Franco) and not killing him makes him so. Too weak.So frustrating to see all the great pieces there but fall apart. It seems to want to have a message of sacrifice and love and all that. None of it hits home. And sometimes it falls into raw reality. Then it shifts into bizarre surrealism. I guarantee at Glass's Q&A people were wondering about the steroid Gigantess scene. Ooooof. So so messy.Any way, I wasn't the slightest bit moved by their relationship. Nor convinced any love exists between them.Sad sad weak movie. Look at ""Bound"" to see what real cinema looks like."," Very Lazy ""Bound"""
"136","Love Lies Bleeding","Avwillfan89","9/10","1 April 2024","This is such a unique and electrifying premise. The subject of a film noir, featuring female body building and gay women is something that is incredibly exciting.While Rose Glass's first film Saint Maud showed a lot of promise, this film pretty much cements the director as talent to watch.Kristen Stewart is as brilliant as she has ever been in this role. It's one she's clearly very much at ease with. Katie O Brian also truly shines in this role that seemed to be tailor-made for her. Especially given the fact that she not only was a body builder at some point in her life, but she also worked as a police officer for seven years.As for the lesbians going wild about this film, there are a lot of passionate raunchy sex scenes between the two leads, and it is HOT.It also should be noted that NONE of the characters in the film are good people, not even the two lead women. It was a very welcome change to see two gay women in a mainstream film be incredibly flawed and make stupid, and I mean STUPID mistakes.Which brings me to the crux of the film: Careless, obsessive love costs lives.The ""Love is like a drug"" theme is done extremely well here. The unconditional love, the messy love, the destructive love, and the ""love will hurt you the most"" love.There is also a lot to be said on how this plays on bodies. You have Jackie, who was teased as kid for being fat, bulk herself up to the max and be larger than life. In contrast, there is Lou who chain-smokes and eats ready made meals, and Daisy, Lou's possessive and suspicious off again, on again girlfriend who rots her set of teeth with sweets.It's a great little twist on the western noir genre."," Bad gays go everywhere."
"137","Love Lies Bleeding","CANpatbuck3664","9/10","21 March 2024","Love Lies Bleeding grabbed my attention immediately but not in the way I expected. LLB shows it's world in all it's grimy glory and despite the environment and the people populating this film being decidedly skeevy, it's so well filmed and presented visually. That's not a common compliment for me for this style of film. A movie can feature great camera work and fun visuals if it doesn't have a huge production budget but it takes talent to show how unsettling and unappealing something is but yet at the same time cultivate intrigue and hold your attention. I never wanted to physically join Lou or Jackie in this unforgiving moment of their collective lives but I couldn't turn away either. It reminded me a lot of End of Watch in that they found ways to make the movie dynamic even when there's not a lot of action going on just by how it's shot. I have to applaud Rose Glass and her team for getting the most out of their resources and giving us an unconventionally stunning film.It's so easy to watch one bad movie, one bad episode or one bad performance and just assume that's the summation of someone's ability. But I've learned never to count any actor or actress out, I've been proven wrong and I've been happy to admit it when I was. I liked Kristen Stewart a lot in the Charlie's Angels reboot but this is a different kind of work she's doing here. She's completely vulnerable in LLB, she conveys Lou's desperation so well and she disappears into the character. She has great chemistry with Katy O'Brian and if you didn't believe she hadn't turned the corner into being a legitimate leading lady, LLB should put those doubts to rest. Her co-lead Katy O'Brian is every bit her equal as Jackie. Not only is her refined physique impressive but she uses it to reveal how conversely exposed her character's emotional state is. Jackie is an enigma in LLB, you never really learn why she blows into this small town for a fateful rendezvous with Lou or what situation she's fleeing from. O'Brian plays up the mystery of Jackie's background and she demands your consideration from the moment she arrives. I also want to give Dave Franco some credit for doing a great job of playing such a slimy and disgusting character. Dave's always had more range then people have given him credit for and he makes for a great antagonist as J. J. in LLB. Ed Harris is appropriately foreboding as shady backwater gangster Lou Sr. It's a fairly restrained performance from Ed but he's a pro and he knows how to convey a lot through just a mournful look. I also liked Anna Baryshnikov as Daisy, she's twitchy and authentic in an unsettling way which I have to believe was the desired effect.For movies that I really enjoyed I usually have a paragraph for any missteps or minor flaws I may have noticed but I have very few problems with LLB. There were small aspects of the film I didn't enjoy but they didn't feel like mistakes or false notes. I think Rose Glass and her team achieved exactly what they wanted with this film. Love Lies Bleeding is not going to be for everyone but why do we need to issue that disclaimer as if its a warning? I wasn't keen on the moments of magical realism when the rest of the movie is so firmly grounded and I wish we had gotten a more thorough explanation of Lou Sr.'s shadowy business dealings but these were just blips in the journey that barely registered when the ending credits rolled.My favourite kind of experience at the theatre is a pleasant surprise. I saw Love Lies Bleeding on a whim due to the positive buzz from the critics and while it's not perfect, I was blown away by the vision and unique style on display. LLB is a trip (in the psychedelic sense) and while it's appeal will be more niche, the film features fantastic performances, great cinematography and a distinctive feel that's all too rare in cinema today. I'd grade out LLB at an 8.5/10 but I'm rounding up. Provided you weren't perturbed by the description or the trailers, and if you're in the mood for a unique and decidedly raw crime drama, I think this movie has the potential to surprise you. It's not for the squeamish but I'd fully recommend it."," Uncommonly Gritty and Disarmingly Raw but Captivating All the Same"
"138","Love Lies Bleeding","kevin_robbins","7/10","21 March 2024","My wife and I watched Love Lies Bleeding (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline follows a young woman who manages a gym in her small hometown. Meanwhile, a desperate homeless hitchhiker with dreams of becoming a bodybuilder arrives in town and forms a relationship with the gym manager. Their seemingly perfect life is disrupted when the manager's brother-in-law severely beats his wife, sparking a tale of revenge that spirals into deeper complexities.Written and directed by Rose Glass (Saint Maude) and starring Kristen Stewart (Twilight), Anna Baryshnikov (Dickinson), Ed Harris (Needful Things), Dave Franco (Neighbors) and Katy O'Brian (The Mandalorian).This movie excels in so many ways. The cast is impeccably chosen, and the costumes and portrayal of the 80s era are magnificent. The entire ensemble looks wild, especially Ed Harris. The film maintains a dark, gritty atmosphere reminiscent of a Netflix serial killer docuseries. The cinematography stands out with its elite camera angles, use of colors, and character delivery. The acting, particularly by Stewart, is outstanding, and the well-written storyline unveils deep subplots that are compelling. There's an opening toilet scene that almost made me gag, lots of pricks and the action scenes were intense and so well done. The corpses are awesome too. I will say the sex scenes were a bit much and overdone and the ending was a HUGE letdown. They took some liberties with the ending that was eye rolling and left me wondering why that was Glass' direction.In conclusion, Love Lies Bleeding offers enough redeeming qualities to warrant a watch, but its failure to deliver a satisfying conclusion diminishes its impact. I would rate it a 6.5/10 and recommend see it at least once."," Love Lies Bleeding offers enough redeeming qualities to warrant a watch, but its failure to deliver a satisfying conclusion diminishes its impact"
"139","Love Lies Bleeding","spencermcook","6/10","21 January 2024","""Love Lies Bleeding"" is endlessly thrilling, unapologetically gruesome, and potently lustful in its perception of love, or in this case, more so in the idea of attachment. Rose Glass immediately develops an identity on a pulsating energy that intensifies as secrets begin to unravel and intertwine with one another, paired with a score that'll find its way beneath your skin. The visual details are addictive. From extreme close up shots enhanced by an accurate, yet sometimes uncomfortable sound design, to a dark red color palette and slower frames of movement to provoke darkness and uneasiness. Due to timely humor and several montage sequences, there's a lighthearted disguise that masks the severity of how exaggerated and ambitious this story actually is. Whether this works or doesn't work is for you to decide, but regardless of how you feel about the story collectively, I'm confident that there's a refreshing surprise for everyone to experience."," A pulsating romance thriller"

In a parallel story, we get to know Lou's sister Beth, who is married to J. J., an up to no good loser. At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the second film by up-and-coming British director Rose Glass (""Saint Maud""). Here she dives head-on into a crime drama the likes if which you have not seen much before. The movie is super plot-heavy so the less said about that, the better. I will comment that the movie benefits tremendously from the strong lead performances by Kirsten Stewart (as Lou) and Katie O'Brian (as Jackie). Stewart couldn't be further away from the Twilight movies, and couldn't be happier. Ed Harris has a smaller but still juicy part as Lou's father. But in the end the credit for this film must go to Rose Glass, who brings us something off-kilter, but with great result.""Love Lies Bleeding"" premiered at this year's Sundance film festival, to immediate critical acclaim. There is good reason why this movie is currently rated 92% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at today was not attended well.

"142","Love Lies Bleeding","elicopperman","9/10","22 March 2024","As of this month, the highly anticipated new release from A24 known as Love Lies Bleeding has been unleashed. Marking the second feature film from writer / director Rose Glass, the film has been garnering widespread acclaim from both critics and audiences going as far back as its Sundance premiere. In addition to starring the likes of Kristen Stewart, Jena Malone, Dave Franco and Ed Harris, this film is said to be somewhat of a breakout role for actor / martial artist Katy O'Brian as the co-lead. So has this film lived up to its hype or is there not much to it beyond all the pulpy glamour?Set in 1989, the film follows a reclusive gym manager named Lou who falls for an ambitious bodybuilder named Jackie who is headed for Las Vegas, only for their love to inflict drama-filled violence within Lou's criminal family. What seemingly starts out as a saucy thriller laced with lesbian romance and dangerous criminal intake becomes far more intense and gratuitous than one might ever expect upon first viewing. As much as the film emphasizes love woven into a crime-like narrative, Lou and Jackie are far more complicated and messed up than their physical attributes say otherwise. On top of strong chemistry shared by Stewart and O'Brian, the dynamic passion between the cynical isolated woman and the unstable rising bodybuilder is partially what drives them into corruption in both their general lives and the ties between Lou's own family. There is rarely a dull moment to be found as the two go through their troubled environments through adoration and anger through gory violence and steaming drug addled bonding, and that's just part of the fun of the feature.And then there is the small yet intimidating supporting cast, all of which make or break Lou and Jackie depending on what pleases them. Of course Ed Harris makes for a scarily intimidating presence as Lou's crime boss father who can make the act of asking a simple question send shivers down one's spine. That being said, in addition to Lou's scummy brother in law J. J. practically being the reason Jackie knows about Lou's family in the first place, his abusive actions are most reflected from his wife Beth, the brainwashed sister of Lou who can't see past her husband's worst moments. The cast pull off these characters well enough that the few scenes they're in make them feel far more interesting than how the script portrayed them, and they bring so much disturbing authenticity to their general mannerisms that even a seemingly insignificant admirer of Lou named Daisy could leave one watching with goosebumps. At the end of the day, a crime family can only be as ruthless as how a cast portrays them to be, and this film is a prime example of the filmmakers giving their all with them.Now as this film has been compared to the likes of works by James M. Cain, Jim Thompson, David Lynch, and the Coen Brothers, those possible influences feel represented through the actual filmmaking itself. While mostly taking place in New Mexico, the feature makes the most out of its desolate settings with colorfully bleak cinematography, trippy visual sequences, muscle bound editing and an intense soundtrack. The emotional core of both the romantic and pulpy crime scenes are elevated by intense color palettes and powerfully lustful transitions, almost as if the film itself is part concise narrative, part intense trip. Although Las Vegas is not as important in the film as one might assume, it is still presented as the appropriate contrast between the boring mundaneness of Lou's hometown to the point of almost being the achilles heel for Jackie once things spiral out of control. No matter how intense this film can get in its tone and content, the accompanying filmmaking elements add the necessary flavor to make it eye opening from start to finish.If there is any new release to see immediately during women's history month, Love Lies Bleeding is a must see for anyone into crime thrillers laced with steamy romance and gory violence. At a time when lesbian themed crime films are slowly getting a comeback in mainstream and arthouse cinemas, this movie is bound to get a cult following beyond its earned appraisal across the world. 2024 still feels fresh with the types of widespread indie films getting the right amount of attention, so here's hoping that this is just one of the many more critical and commercial darlings yet to come this year."," Saucy Romantic Crime Thriller with All Kinds of Twists & Turns"

Ever since Saint Maud, I have been keeping up with Rose Glass because she has the potential of becoming a modern master filmmaker and this movie really rocks!Glass' direction, writing and approach on the atmosphere, themes and tone are perfect as the 80s vibe, tension, and charm is well-executed. I appreciate how Glass doesn't follow the traditional writing structure and provides some ideas that just breaks all the rules and has fun with it's violent, weird style and tone. The writing also explores some interesting concepts, characters and dynamics being explored with lots of fun dark, bloody, sexy, and wild moments that are purely entertaining. The performances are great as Kristen Stewart is really good but Katy O'Brian really steals the show here and each provided great chemistry dynamics together. Good soundtrack and pacing as well.I appreciate how Glass is able to provide some really bold moments and the way she approaches the 80s romance thriller without feeling messy or all over the place. Everything felt perfect of what I wanted from an 80s vibe thriller. One small issue is that I felt one certain character development could have been explored just a bit.But overall, it was a blast.

Ed Harris from ""TOP GUN MAVERICK"" does an phenomenal job for his role as LOU SR. There is a quote which I'll probably share this. ""Only love can bleed forever; only love has endless blood. Only love's slender drooping tassels can bleed yet grow stronger, bleed yet grow brighter; redder, redder, never spent, never phantasmal-gray. Maybe, if it only gets kicked, then love is love-lies-dented"" A24 Is a studio company I truly love and especially when MAXXINE comes out as soon as possible I'm predicting that It is in this phantasmagorically corporeal obsession that Glass reveals the shared DNA of ""Saint Maud"" and ""Love Lies Bleeding,"" which are both about the twisted expansiveness of the female imagination, and whether or not that can transcend reality.Rose Glass's Love Lies Bleeding is a refreshing throwback -- not only in its beautifully set in the 1980s setting but in its general willingness to embrace its identity."," Love Lies Bleeding is a LGBTQ Revenge Story, A24 is weird but it's excellent"

Not to undermine Glass' efforts by mentioning a contemporary, but the comparison's apt and there has already been discourse among the two of them showing mutual affinity. Glass might have leaned into the body horror, but the sexual politics are all her own, and despite the seemingly routine plotting, there's always a trick up her devilish sleeve in terms of shock and layered intensity. The question of what we're supposed to want, as the audience, kept lingering, but I'm not sure that hurts the film's effectiveness because what we know for sure is that we want Lou Lou to be safe. Whatever weird contradictions take place, as far as our allegiance goes, only helps the picture as fas as I'm concerned. Maybe my main issue lies with not hating Ed Harris enough, though he is very well portrayed (visually) as a monstrous force against our wishes.Early call as to Glass' motifs: Uncomfortable bedside chats."," Love Lies"

Kristen, Katy, Anna, Ed and Dave all delivered on their roles. The chemistry between Kristen and Katy is top notch and gives a certain freshness to a lesbian relationship and power dynamic in film.

The songs are clever and have a classic ring to them that help bridge the 50-year gap between the films. On the darker side (it wouldn't be a Wonka story without one), we also see how the young and naive chocolatier was exposed to the greed, corruption and deceit that undoubtedly shaped him into the shrewd mystic he would become. Overall everything fits comfortably together and I tip my hat to Paul King and all of the filmmakers for getting this right, which was a considerable challenge."," Whimsical, Witty and Worthy Wonka"
"158","Wonka","tobymcrossley","10/10","31 December 2023","At first glance, Wonka seems like a cynical cash grab, but it really isn't. This film manages to deliver everything I want from a Willy Wonka film and there's many elements that make it so great in my opinion.First off, the acting is amazing with every single one of the cast giving a great performance whether it's Keegan-Michael Key or even Hugh Grant and some of them also can provide some good laughs.Next, the directing which is definitely a good part of the film as it has Paul King as director who is well known for directing the first two Paddington films which is definitely where the comedy and the light-hearted humour come from.Also, the music was a special highlight of the film and I know how some people may be put off by the fact that it's a musical, and how Warner Bros. Did nothing to advertise it but the music was definitely key standout of the film and how I was loving nearly every single song and I think that it succeeds in being a good musical.Finally, I wanted to dedicate this specific point about the overall major star of the film Timoth√©e Chalamet as the titular character, I was loving every second of Timoth√©e's performance and I think he did a fantastic job where I hope he gets an Oscar nomination for his outstanding performance.In conclusion, Wonka is an excellent, outstanding and wonderful film that I think deserves a watch because it seems like it's great for the family to enjoy with its wonderful characters, enjoyable comedy, amazing songs and outstanding performances and I hope that Timoth√©e Chalamet gets more recognition for his role in this film and that he does more singing roles in future movies."," As Sweet as Chocolate!"

This film had me smiling and it hit just the right notes.The actors were PERFECTION! Loves the music and just the right balance of all ingredients (just like a wonkabar) for a lovely film.Just LOVELY!Saw another review here saying: ""this had bo business being this good"" and this was very VERY true!The only thing that could have improved this for me would be if you received a wonka chocolate to enjoy with the movie!"," Well that was unexpected..."
"160","Wonka","storyteller3982","6/10","10 March 2024","Absolutely marvelous! The whimsey, the joy, it was simply a delight! There were so many fantastic homages to the classic movie, a thousand easter eggs, down to mimicking Gene Wilder's posture and mannerisms, chin resting on hand with a waggle of his eye brows.There were three main criticisms I had:
-the music could have been much better. It wasn't very great, and is largely forgettable
-The CGI wasn't spectacular either
-Timothy oversold it a little, (though over all he felt very appropriate. But it did take away at times)Gene's Willy Wonka, fantastic and bonkers chocolate magician though he may be, took his work and himself Very seriously. Timothy's portrayal and the movie's penchant to view the silly as silly threw things off a little.Further, the original movie was a fantastic adventure grounded in reality. Having more practical special effects would have helped make it like feel more like a world of imagination made real, instead of still an imaginary land. I think that's what's so important to get right if you're referencing the classic movie.That being said, the tone, the wonder, the nostalgia was spot on. If you loved Gene Wilder's classic movie you'll (either hate what this movie gets wrong) or be delighted with the intention they paid to getting the smallest details right."," An Absolute Delight! But missing a couple key elements"

I enjoyed seeing the actors really have fun with each of their roles and play into the silliness of each character. I went in not expecting much and my friends and I were pleasantly surprised with how much fun we had. The songs were all delightful and very catchy, we were singing them on the car ride home! Good watch for the family. Though I will say that this version of Wonka is not quite as nuts as ones we've seen in previous movies but still a delightful experience. I would definitely recommend this film to a friend who was looking for something to brighten their day."," Heartwarming and Silly"
"163","Wonka","blakemorley","10/10","7 January 2024","In a way we are quite lucky that slightly over 50th years after the first adaptation of the story to screen there has only been two other films since. Afterall Willy Wonka is such a beloved film that any attempt to make another film based off it should be carefully thought out.The idea of doing a prequel focusing on Wonka was concerning to me as I did side with the view that it should be left a mystery. However I was pleasantly surprised this film kept the backstory modest and just focused on the story of overthrowing other greedy chocolatiers that are just doing it for financial gain.I liked all the actors in the film, although I do find it odd that they didn't hire a Dwarf to play an Oompa Loompa considering how little work actors who are little people generally get. I did also struggle to see what roles some of the characters Willy Wonka teamed up with really contributed to the story.Music was fun but it's not quite as catchy as the music from the 1971 or even the 2005 remake. In the end though they are just story telling tools.To conclude the film is tight, incredibly well structured and quite different to the previous two films. Some people may be disappointed by the film but I went into the cinema with no expectations and was happy to see a film with enthusiasm and drive behind it as opposed to something heavily commercial just aiming to sell toys and milk a franchise until audiences regret turning up to see the latest entry."," Good film for what it was"

The singing and the dancing I just love the fun of chocolates really enjoyed the characters the costumes and the story of Wonka.Anyone who has watched the original Gene Wilder character persona will love this version of Willy Wonka also the character feels so relatable to the original character. The modern version has some lovely elements brought in with their own unique style it's a lovely family fun movie and yes I would watch it again.

Its wonderful to you watch with your family.The world is needing movies like that each time more.It just has a little lack. It could explain more the Oompa Loompa and explore more the character and its history. But it does not breaks the magic of movie. I loved itOther point. It could has a little bit less songs.

Chalmet is a charming soul. Political, yes but remains balanced in telling its story. Plain fun entertainment, too bad that people have to compare it to two very different adaptations and judge it based on that, rather than its own proformance. I like the Dicken's twist. Not for everyone, but musical lovers with enjoy the song and dance numbers. Feels like a children's book brought to life, which is the point here. I will see it in theaters again, and I've already pre-ordered the film to add to my personal collection."," Wonderful addition to the story"

It focuses on the beauty of having true friends and family you can rely on and does not focus on the ""making"" of candy or behind the scenes which suits it perfectly ! I loved it!! Timothee is an amazing actor as portrayed in his movie Dune sequel he definitely has the ability to play different characters that are so different to begin with and still have great success in both! Just wow Warner brothers studios made an amazing movie once again and am please to say that this movie ending made me cry because of the heartfelt ending !!! Will definitely purchase in dvd!"," Must see to keep tradition alive"
"168","Wonka","noamansayyed-54162","9/10","17 December 2023","Wonka is one of the best musical I've seen in recent times. I do agree with some people that the songs fail to excite you. But that doesn't mean the movie is not. It is good and I mean really good there was only one songs which failed to meet my excitement level other than that pretty good. Timothee Chalamet takes everything on his shoulder and gives us an unforgettable experience. Other actors are terrific too but my favourite after timothee is Keegan-Micheal Kay. In simple words this movie is definitely worth a watch in the cinemas and trust me you will not regret it. Every movie has flaws remember that."," Let your inner child out."
"169","Wonka","squidddsansy","7/10","17 December 2023","It's surprising how this film can be better than the other past films, it has a better construction of characters and personality, especially the personality of the main character; Willy Wonka. In the other movies, like the first one from the 80s. His personality in that film was really bad explored, but, in the second one, made by Tim Burton, it has really better construction, even if it's not really perfect. Now, in 2023, we can see the character of Willy Wonka being very well explored, with more pf his past and more of his dreams and real personality. In my opinion, this is the best movie of the franchise."," Really great."
"170","Wonka","andrewbufalo-77479","8/10","21 December 2023","Initially, I thought this movie was a cruel attempt to pick the pockets of millions of nostalgic fans. I watched the trailer and began to be slightly charmed by the idea. Then, I saw the ""Quiet up and listen down! Scratch that, reverse it!"" scene which I found to be nothing short of a tacky and inaccurate portrayal of the original Willy Wonka. As you can probably tell my emotions surrounding the film were hardly consistent. I finally pulled the trigger and went to see it today and I was delightfully surprised. I'll give you the breakdown:ACTING: 6/10
Timothee Chalamet's acting felt forced and unconvincing which is no fault of his own. Timothee is, generally, a ""quiet"" actor and tends to star in films that are serious and/or intimate. His roles are often literally and figuratively quiet which is, in my opinion, why he stuck out like a sore thumb. I think that he is an amazing actor who just happened to be cast in the wrong role. Timothee aside, the rest of the main cast gave a charming performance that gave the film a wholesome vibe.PRODUCTION: 8/10
I am no expert so take this with a grain of salt. I found the production to be effectively fantastical but not tacky. Most of the uses of special effects were done well and made for some cute scenes that will likely make you smile. I think that in this category one has to adjust their expectations to the type of movie they are watching.PLOT: 6/10
This film provides the backstory of the famous chocolatier Willy Wonka.Young Willy grew up in a boat house with his single mother in New England. His mother was somewhat of a chocolatier herself and is who taught Willy his various culinary skills. As expected, she dies when he is young and before she can fulfill her promise of opening a Chocolate shop with him. When he grows up he makes a journey to what I can only assume is London to open his first Chocolate shop next to three famous candy entrepreneurs who aren't exactly friendly. They plot to ruin Willy's reputation and career but are stopped by the young Mr. Wonka and all of the wonderful friends he made along the way. I would go into more detail but I don't wish to spoil the film for anyone who may read this. I would like to point out a rather major deviation from the original canon. In the film, it is revealed that Willy can't read which I'm sure was added to make us feel bad for the otherwise brilliant Candyman. However, in the original canon, he attended Cambridge University where he earned his Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. This would surely mean that he was at least moderately intelligent and, of course, literate. Overall, the plot was wholesome and provided me with an entertaining experience."," Surprisingly good despite Timothee Chalamet"
"171","Wonka","evanthekitty","9/10","22 December 2023","This story was a fantastic starting ground for a mad genius we know and love in Gene Wilders performance. This narrative made for something truly fun and tearjerking at times, surrounded by such a lovely cast of unique and odd characters, just like our lively protagonist. Timoth√©e Chalamet proves he has range outside some of his other roles and delivers such a wonderful performance as the infamous Willy Wonka. The songs of this film, while catchy and enjoyable, I feel so miss a certain magic the original 1971 film holds near and dear to my heart. A wonderful movie nonetheless for this holiday season, and I implore it be a lovely time you check out in theaters with the whole family!"," A Magical Callback In Modern Limelight"
"172","Wonka","echo-the-coder","7/10","29 December 2023","I walked into this movie, thinking that it was not going to be that great and just stay overall children's movie filled with flashing lights and colors. I was pleasantly surprised I was able to draw some conclusions between the chocolate in this make believe world and big oil one thing that I did not find so great is the lack of depth for the villains, they're so purpose is just to control the market of chocolate, which is good and all but they didn't really have any motivation for that besides money. The actors played their parts extremely well. The music was wonderful and I can tell a lot of effort was put into this film. It is a great watch, and I would highly recommend it."," Great movie, but antagonist needs more depth"
"173","Wonka","kelspc","10/10","16 January 2024","I really liked this movie and enjoyed watching it in theaters. However I could've waited because the songs weren't life changing and the visuals were all mainly computerized. Which I do not condemn the use of technology in movies because it works for certain things that have a lot of time being put into it. But I can tell this movie didn't have a lot of time put into it which is a little disappointing. I do like Timothee Chalamet in it! He does a pretty good
Job at being Willy Wonka and does portray a good version of his teenage years. I don't know, I enjoyed watching it but I probably won't watch it again... purposely."," Liked but not Loved!"
"174","Wonka","alicia_robson","8/10","25 January 2024","I saw this three times in theatres. Twice with my kids!It sits somewhere between satire and serious. Sort of like the Barbie movie. The ""bad guys"" are comically satire, while Wonka's stories and ingredients are delivered with the upmost seriousness. You love the bad guys in here nearly as much as you love the good guys! If not more!The music is incredibly catchy and frequently gets stuck in my head. By 3/4 through the movie, you'll feel like a child again while watching something whimsical however clearly geared towards an adult audience.This very much was tailored towards the millennials who fell in love with the original as a child, and who felt like the initial chocolate factory remake was not hitting the mark. I love Johnny Depp, but it wasn't funny.This is hilarious. Our protagonist does such a great job an being unknowingly funny, much like his older Gene Wilder self does in the original."," A New Favourite!!"
"175","Wonka","jakebaker-33466",NA,"2 January 2024","Following Gene Wilder & Jonny Depp isn't easy but Chalamet does a great job regardless and puts a new spin on the role. That eerie unnerving aura is slightly missing from Wonka but you can forgive that to future character development. This version of the story has the right amount of creativity,fun,music and plenty of feeling to make this a worth while visit to a recognised story. Also despite his publicised distaste for the role Hugh Grant makes a great Umpa Lumpa! Despite already having the follow up to the movies ready this film does a good enough job to make you want to see more of this Wonka and his new friends."," A pleasant surprise"
"176","Wonka","imseeg","6/10","9 December 2023","Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."," It looks the part, the actors are terrific, but the actual story and the songs fail to really excite me."
"177","Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","8/10","26 December 2023","Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."," I Didn't Want to Like it but Wonka is Disarmingly Charming and Whimsical"
"178","Wonka","masonsaul","8/10","9 December 2023","On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."," The best version of a cynical idea"
"179","Wonka","Larsii90","6/10","17 December 2023","Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."," Missing that Oomph"
"180","Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","5/10","20 February 2024","I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."," High expectations were dashed"
"181","Wonka","davidallenxyz","5/10","24 December 2023","Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."," An average movie. Don't believe the hype."
"182","Wonka","kevin_robbins","4/10","18 December 2023","My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."," Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023"
"183","Wonka","eddie_baggins","8/10","14 December 2023","Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"," 2023's most enjoyable holiday hit"
"184","Wonka","kjreiter","4/10","18 February 2024","This is another one of those movies (turned out to be a musical) that I really wanted to like. Unfortunately it is a one and done for me. The songs are forgettable, and the story is boring. What a shame. The 8,9, and 10 reviews are way off, as usual. I wonder what they would give to an actually great movie? Read the 1,2,3, and 4 reviews as they cover it all without me going through it again. The good: the setting is interesting, the acting is good, and the CGI is ok. If Hollywood keeps putting out stinkers like this, nobody is ever going to return to the theaters like they did 5 years ago. For the sake of the theatre industry, please do better than this. Boring movie, I mean musical. Stream it if you must."," Yawn... Boring and forgettable."
"185","Wonka","jgeorge4","5/10","17 December 2023","I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."," I Don't Think Hollywood Can Make Good Movies Anymore"
"186","Wonka","DeltaHomicide","9/10","6 December 2023","I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."," An Imaginative Fantastic Journey"
"187","Wonka","vassiliskounelis","4/10","22 January 2024","I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."," Mixed Feelings on Wonka"
"188","Wonka","destiny_west","1/10","23 January 2024","I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."," What Hell Was This!"

And not enough catchy songs

"190","Wonka","Sleepin_Dragon","8/10","8 December 2023","Ever wonder how Willy Wonka made it, how he would one day be in a position to one day send out those golden tickets? This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."," A perfect festive treat."
"191","Wonka","BA_Harrison","3/10","8 December 2023","Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."," The Candy Man can't."
"192","Wonka","roxlerookie","2/10","20 January 2024","I found myself skipping through, watched the beginning and the last quarter. It's awful on many levels.I loved Paddington, both in fact. They were wonderful.I also loved Ronald Dahl s books as a kid.I also remember fondly the Johnny Depp version.Now this one was an infuriating mess. Chamalet can't sing, which is a big deal given this happens to be a musical, and I dislike musicals.The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, the characters are so clich√© yet incredibly bad, it's like an AI wrote a Dickens novel for chickens. Dreadful really.Even the cgi was bad. It's also pretty nihilistic as everybody is a terrible person, down to the church staff.We deserved better. And the legacy of this IP also deserved better."," Terrible"
"193","Wonka","thesuthernman","6/10","14 January 2024","I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."," Loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere"

It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free.

The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city . Story , acting and cinematography all absolutely brilliant and the back story was as emotional as Oliver , this has all the makings of a cult classic and great stage musical very much similar to the greatest show - go see itPad.

"197","Wonka","Socolorfull","4/10","7 January 2024","Boring about sums it up. We all know that just because a film has a few big names in it doesn't mean it will be great. It tries to be whimsical, but fails. The songs are mediocre. Noodle is supposed to be the heart of the movie, but her acting leaves much to be desired. Yes, she is a child, but if you're going to make a child the emotional center of a movie, that child needs to be able to carry that, and she can't.Has any sequal/prequel/offshoot of the Wonka universe ever captured the zany magic of the original? I don't think so, so maybe we should stop trying.This movie was at its best and most fun when people were eating wonka's magical chocolate. Everything in between that was just bad fluff. The repetitiveness of the movie was grating to me. Please stop with the same joke over and over and over again.The end did come to a sweet conclusion that may make you tear up a bit, but the ride to get there just isn't worth it.Skip this one. And if you are going to see it, don't bring your three year old with you. Where in the previews did it seem like this would be a movie that would entertain a toddler??? It's a live action musical, for goodness sake. Please save yourself, and everyone else in the theater, a headache, and don't bring your toddler to this movie.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!Who thought that a chocolate cartel would be a fun little plot device? This movie was billed as a family film. While sure, there are things in a family film meant to go over the head of the kids in the audience, these are usually throwaway jokes that don't impact understanding of the plot. The chocolate cartel was the WHOLE conflict of the movie. What does a child know about a cartel?"," Slightly Whimsical But Mostly Boring"
"198","Wonka","magiciancolin","1/10","16 January 2024","As a fan of the Gene Wilder film and someone who can enjoy the Johnny Depp film. This was not it. No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."," WONKA, WHAT WAS THAT!?"
"199","Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","10/10","24 December 2023","I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."," This had no business being this good!"
"200","Wonka","robfollower","6/10","1 January 2024","The reception is quite positive for Wonka . I however could not get into this film It is not bad , the film is just to tame . ""Wonka"" could use more tart notes; at times it's borderline saccharine. There's no shiver of menace here, this is not the persona Willy Wonka is known for being sarcastic in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. Wonka is a quirky, eccentric character who is known for brushing off questions and using sarcasm to ignore them ,this is what make the role such a good character Study .It takes only moments into the film, when star Timoth√©e Chalamet first opens his mouth to sing, to discover Wonka's errors: The songs are that not good, and the guy singing them is even worse.Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka. Performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming . There is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesn't take me on a trip like the original did. Or for that matter the 2005 Johnny Depp version ; FYI If you love Weird and strange Depp's acting is for you. It is bat crazy !Some of the songs of this the 2023 reimaging tale weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless. On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive. 6/10.Everlasting gobstopper ...........No one will ever play the bright comic exterior and dark soul of Willy Wonka like Gene Wilder did in 1971. Wilder remains the gold standard in the role of Willy Wonka with his mad genius -- which featured a snarky edge and a hint of darkness."," Everlasting gobstopper ........... Not ."
