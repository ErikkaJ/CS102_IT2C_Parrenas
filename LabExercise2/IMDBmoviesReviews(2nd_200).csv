"1","Poor Things","parksiet","4/10","31 December 2023","Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"," Not for me"
"2","Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","5/10","23 January 2024","Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."," Turns out the real poor things were the audience all along."
"3","Poor Things","kjproulx","10/10","6 January 2024","For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."," The Weirdest Masterpiece I've Seen in Many Years"
"4","Poor Things","Billybobble1","3/10","26 February 2024","While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in."," I shall try to erase this one from my memory"
"5","Poor Things","imseeg","5/10","9 December 2023","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"," Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating."
"6","Poor Things","aciessi","9/10","24 December 2023","If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."," A Bizarre Masterpiece"
"7","Poor Things","nicko252008","2/10","24 January 2024","The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."," WTF did I just watch?

"8","Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","1/10","12 March 2024","A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."," Pompous and Grotesque"
"9","Poor Things","pd-19490","1/10","20 January 2024","My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."," Not for me"
"10","Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","1/10","27 February 2024","There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."," What did I just watch?"

They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting.

Full frontal nudity of both sexes throughout.The doctor's assistant agrees to marry Emma Stone (baby brain in mother's body) despite the fact she is so mentally handicapped, she can barely walk or form a complete sentence.

I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"".

In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange.

I felt sickened by half of the scenes, but staying and watching out of an admitted morbid fascination, and the disappointed hope it would somehow get better. I've seen a few of Yorgos Lanthimos's other films, and knew better than to expect something other than weird from him, but this was too much for me. Very sad that Emma Stone has decided to go in this direction in her career. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm going to do my best to forget I've seen it. I feel like I need a hot shower now to wash this horrible slime from me."," I wish I'd never seen this. My eyes hurt. Poor Emma."
"20","Poor Things","Victor_Santamaria","1/10","27 January 2024","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."," Boring, flat, extremely overrated"

"22","Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","9/10","22 January 2024","Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."," An Unconventional Mind"
"23","Poor Things","moviedays1","1/10","10 January 2024","Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high.

In this way It will only look more disgusting and 2B.The three male characters in the film dominate the heroine, but every time the heroine's choice is wrong.Every time she feels that her choice is right, it collapses the next second.Most of the male protagonists in the film reveal greasy, perverted, obscene and obscene psychology, as if in their hearts. Women are their own controls, and they can only be used as their own sexual tools to vent. I know that the director wants. To use the psychology of several men to highlight the personality that the heroine is controlled and cannot find freedom, but this way seems too superficial, and in the end, the way the heroine escapes seems too fake and idealistic.I don't think this is a story about desire.

On the other hand, Dorothy did not spend the back half of ""Oz"" having gratuitous sex with the Scarecrow, any of the flying monkeys, or the men of Oz.DaFoe is still the consummate actor, and his portrayal of the gruesomely disfigured ""God""win, a gifted surgeon and educator is well played. His character actually seemed more interesting than Bella.The storyline truly required a sensational level of the suspension of disbelief. Like Oz, where scarecrows, tin men and lions could talk, Godwin used his surgical talents for not evil, as much as for weirdness. The initial observation of a dog with a chicken body and a duck with pigs body portrayed what was to come.The denouement of Bellas originated life leading her to make a terminal choice in the final 20 minutes of the film were more unusual and interesting than not.Overall, I'm glad we fought the urge to walk out after 20 minutes or so.

"36","Poor Things","cmagill-29345","8/10","17 December 2023","While quite an accomplishment deserving of praise, Poor Things is a challenging movie to recommend as it is in many ways very uncomfortable viewing . . . Which I'm guessing is part of the point. The pros are that it is beautifully shot, with very unique camera perspectives; has some very funny at moments; and the lead character played by Stone is fearless and shows tremendous growth throughout the film. However, it will be hard for many to get past the vulgerness, gratuitous violence and sex, callousness of the characters, and plot points that challenges moral code. While I think the film maker handled many of these concepts brilliantly while managing to successfully express clear messages of despair, hopelessness, and personal growth, the gratuity is pushed in excess to a point where the message becomes muddled in the shock value. A couple sitting next to me in the theater walked out in the first 10 minutes.

This to me is a well thought out movie and this directior is famous for doing thoughtful movies like this. This is the first work of Yorgos Lanthimos I've seen and he's done really cool projects like the Lobster and killing of a sacred deer etc and I can't believe this is his first project I'm seeing and honestly he has an exceptional mind. Poor things is a movie you have to get comfortable with at least you'd have to get comfortable with the black and white era once you can go through that it becomes a more comfortable sailing all through. This to me is a love story on many levels and I'd try my best to express myself here. The protagonist Bella Baxter when introduced is done in a way to make you a little bit uncomfortable kept in a house by someone that could be called a monster but for some reason don't see it (_because children don't see monsters but they see kindness and cruelty and the doctor showed her kindness even though he knew little of it_) the doctor (Godwin Baxter) was a man very brilliant and intelligent but never knew or probably understood why or how his father showed him so much cruelty while his father saw him as an object for experiment he saw Bella as what she is a human who deserved love and gave it to her the best way he could imagine it.(_tho she was an experiment too_) Max Mccandles shows a softer more unconditional love and a lil bit of guilt. He knew Bella was a child and that guilt plagued him he knew that he couldn't trust her with any decision even though she looked like an adult. But why I say or use the word unconditional is because of Duncan Wedderburn who had a possessive love for Bella who liked her for that hint of innocence she had, the kind that made her oblivious of her environment and so she never reads the room. Her love with Toinette is what I'd call friendship love tho they were intimate I still see it as that and mind you this is mostly from a Bella POV the way she views the world her curiosity, gullibility and how people wanted to use her especially when she got to Paris. (_I don't want this to be long cos I have a lot to say but if you've read this long I think this review contains spoilers please forgive me for not indicating it earlier_).

It's a symphony of rebellion, a joyous, raucous middle finger to the suffocating strictures of ""polite society."" This isn't whimsical Frankenstein; it's a scalpel dipped in satire, gleefully dissecting the vile social rules that have become a cage for the human spirit.Imagine, if you will, a world where the shackles of repression are ripped away. Where a mind, liberated from the stifling grip of societal expectations, inhabits an adult body under the full torment of youthful hormonal cocktail . This is Bella, a glorious explosion of uninhibited life. She devours the world with a primal hunger, a whirlwind of sex, laughter, food and dance. Each act of defiance is a vibrant brushstroke on the canvas of her existence, a testament to the power of embracing one's true self, skin and all.""Poor Things"" is a beacon for body positivity and a fierce champion of female agency. Bella, even when she is a Parisian prostitute with a thirst for life, demands a radical shift in power dynamics. What if, she posits, women chose their clients for that furious dance of pleasure? This isn't mere entertainment; it's a revolution brewing in petticoats and laughter.The film doesn't shy away from the raw realities of this rebellion. There's a bittersweet beauty in the way it captures Bella's journey, the yearning for a life unbound from the chains of societal expectations. It forces us to confront the very essence of freedom, the audacious act of simply being oneself in a world that demands conformity.Adapted from Alasdair Gray's novel, yet set in a whimsically anachronistic late-Victorian era, the film crackles with darkly humorous parodies of Romantic melodrama. Its visual distortions and grotesque moments add to the unsettling atmosphere. Yet, at its core, ""Poor Things"" champions uninhibited existence, asking us to question societal norms. The performances, especially Emma Stone's portrayal of Bella's evolution, crackle with intensity. This is a film that will ignite some and unsettle others. For some prudish men and women it will be like molten lead poured through their eyes and ears and such is it's intended intensity.""Poor Things"" is more than entertainment; it's a call to arms. Watch it, and let the fire ignite within you.

What starts off well is ruined in the latter part of the film, from the protagonist arriving in Paris onwards. The films design (art, costume, sound, cinematography) and acting are superb.

However, don't go in expecting something super deep. This movie has a few things it wants to say that it does not always wrap up quite so nicely nor be very coherent in telling it. The twist at the end felt quite forced.The acting wasn't quite on the same level across the board. Emma Stone, of course, was phenomenal. Mark Ruffalo's acting, on the other hand, was in my opinion slightly over the top and unrealistic and not as nuanced as I had hoped.Poor Things is neither a light-hearted movie you watch to give your brain some rest nor one with a meaningful message that leaves you thinking for days afterwards.

"48","Poor Things","juicefetish","6/10","7 March 2024","Poor Things is not going to be for everyone. There were even points in it where I was a bit put off, but man do I respect this film. Why...?Because it's a film - Not a movie.In a day where it feels like virtually anything that Hollywood releases is put through an assembly line of predictability where you can feel commercial interests dumbing things down to appeal to the widest audience for maximum profit...Poor Things just ""goes for it"" in a way that so few movies do. That's why it's a film and it's a damn good one.There's a myriad of reasons to see Poor Things and Emma Stone has to be right up there at the top. She's amazing and the type of actor where any performance she gives will be interesting at least and perhaps even truly special.And I'm not even a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos, but to me it feels like this is his ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" in that I didn't really love any of his previous work, but I love this one.And pay attention to the music. Man...I cannot recall seeing a movie where the filmmakers used what could be such off-putting music, but it works here and speaks to the courage of Lanthimos/the producers for trying to serve the story over what might be more appealing.I felt the first half of the movie was really going places, but it lags and goes a bit off down the stretch. That was disappointing to me as it was asking the right questions about life and experience in such a fresh, unique, and funny way, and I was really hoping they would ""bring it home.""

I rather enjoy watching something different, and there are some great shots, scenes & background on top of the captivating performances, as well as the said satire, so I give it an 8, yet my wife likes her films more realistic and using a more traditional language, so to speak, so although she was getting engaged towards the end, she did not enjoy it.

"51","Spaceman","leonidasoriginal","7/10","2 March 2024","Adam Sandler does a good job in this drama, but you're probably asking yourself ""Why the spider""? Well, It is the most common fear among people (Arachnophobia). But do you know what are people even more afraid of? Accepting the truths about themselves and being completely honest with yourself. Now, combine all that and you get answers to everything about this, actually decent movie. That is why the spider crawls out of him in his dreams (subconscious), which is the beginning of his transformation and self-learning, self-knowledge. To realize you are selfish, a coward, and victim-mentality, it takes strength, but most of all ""no filters about yourself"". Are you a bad person? Can you go that deep into your mind to fight your demons? Just as a spider (at the beginning) so is self-learning. It is ugly and hard until you finally reach the goal - wanting to and eventually changing your wrong ways and also shedding parts of you (selfishness, bitterness, anger, victim mentality). Most people never reach this transformation, but he did. It started as an ""ugly"" huge spider, one, you later get to love. It is the TRUTH - The truth is ugly at the beginning but eventually, it sets you free, you start to love it, admire it, and learn. The truth about who you are, what, and why you did wrong. It is the ultimate goal and the beginning of a new life to overcome that battle and become fully honest with yourself. IS THE SPIDER REAL? I think not. I think Hanush is not real, it is Adam's (Jakob) projection of his subconscious, guilt, anger, and bitterness, but also all good inside, like love, acceptance, and understanding. That deep need to change what later becomes truth and ultimately the realization of his mistakes. It sets him free to open up and become a selfless, better man. At the same time, he ends battles within, he lets go of guilt, sadness, regret, and bitterness... they are all gone in the nebula, and that is why clear skies open."," A man being honest with himself - My answer to ""Was Hanush real?"""

"54","Spaceman","NinaCu","9/10","2 March 2024","This screenplay will touch upon more and deeper psychological issues than most viewers are able or ready to explore within their own psyche. Hence, reviews such as, ""it fails to consistently engage with its most interesting ideas."" I.e., one's inward journey into their own psyche is of little to no interest for the average person. And... that is precisely why the Earth is full of problems caused by human infestation -- to quote V-ger (ST:TMP).Movies addressing psychological issues and motifs are gaining traction in the movie industry, and can make quite a profit -- such as Barbie.For the rest of us who are open to considering what lay beyond our inner limitations, this is an absolutely wonderful movie, perfectly juxtaposing innerspace with outerspace, and the cyclical dichotomy of the end being the beginning, at multiple levels. The direction and editing establish an absolutely perfect pace for the premise of solo space travel and introspection, analogous to Silent Running (1972). The set design is remarkably plausible.Last but not least, this is the best performance by Adam Sandler since Punch Drunk Love (2002). And the irony in this movie is that when Sandler overcomes whatever issues keep him from taking on deep and serious roles -- in a manner similar to the character he plays in this movie -- he is absolutely amazing in revealing the gift of his own personal depth.(Minus one star for psychological issues not written by, or without consultation of, psychology experts.)"," Outer Space meets Inner Space"
"55","Spaceman","AlienRobotZombieOverlord","8/10","2 March 2024","I understand that a lot of people probably rated this low because they saw that it starred Adam Sandler and came into it expecting Happy Gilmore. I did not. I am a sci-fi enthusiast, and I cut my teeth on some of the great, old masterpieces of the '50s and '60s -- many of them by Czech authors, just like this one was! These novels and films were ones that modern audiences might see as ""dry"" these days, but they were hard-core sci-fi that packed an emotional punch while telling a story of speculative fiction -- a world that ""advanced the timeline"" from our own to see how the human psyche, human morality, human frailty, would cope with advances in technology. And that's exactly what we have here -- a Czech astronaut put in an extraordinary circumstance, even fantastical by the standards of our ""real world."" And yet, the actual story isn't fantastical at all -- it's a simple question of the human heart, and the meaning of life. In that way, it's not so different from a one-act, heavy-dialogue drama... but by framing it as a science fiction film, we can strip out any modern-day distractions and just focus on human nature in its purest form.And maybe enjoy Paul Dano's absolutely riveting performance as a giant arachnid alien!This is a must-see for any lover of ""pure"" sci-fi or ""old-school"" sci-fi. 8/10."," Pure, old-school, trippy sci-fi"

This film is about humanity, what happens when we deny our emotions and turn to empty heroic pursuits. This film is about everything and nothing, time, space and most importantly - the intergalactic appeal of hazelnut chocolate spread. It's also about an incredibly wise, giant spider with cute little teeth.It has a touch of David Lynch about it, especially with the Isabella Rossellini factor. It navigates the uneasy edge of menace and humour, but with a plot that actually makes sense.It also reminded me of eternal sunshine of a spotless mind with the retro fittings, brick phone, and chunky eastern block tech, placing the film both in the future and the past at the same time.Bravo for making a film about space that isn't about space or man's burning ambition to beat the odds. Bravo for making a film that is less than two hours long and never gets boring. Bravo for doing something entirely different and putting two actors together I never thought I'd see in the same frame.After seeing Adam Sandler in Hidden Gems I became a fan, and I'm an even bigger one now, and Carey Mulligan is excellent, as usual. Although I have to say if anything annoyed me in the film it was the age difference between Carey Mulligan's character and her mother. The mother looked perhaps 10 years older than the daughter, max... how's that work...? Same old same old. The reluctance to cast older-looking, age appropriate women in this industry continues...Lots of people won't like this movie. For many reasons. If you're expecting a film about mr big dick beating the odds in a tin can you'll be be sadly disappointed.

It begins with Adam Sandler as an astronaut traveling towards a mysterious purple cloud to see what's what with that, but instead of a space drama we get a marital drama involving Sandler's character and his pregnant wife (Carey Mulligan in the least interesting performance I've ever seen her give) on Earth who has decided that while he is alone in space is a good time to announce she's leaving him! During this flight the astronaut suddenly has a companion who looks very much like a gigantic multi-legged, multi-eyed speaking spider who may or may not be a hallucination. The spider and the astronaut talk endlessly about a variety of things but mainly his negligence to what matters the most in life, his wife and his life on Earth. Now, one can understand why she would not want to be married to a man who leaves her behind to go out into space, but she kind of signed up for this to begin with so that didn't make much sense to me, especially given it's only a one year trip that he is halfway through. It also didn't make sense to me that the astronaut is so depressed and perhaps hallucinatory after those first 6 months. This seems an awfully short time for an experienced astronaut trained for this to start unraveling. How does it end? Well, you'll have to watch it to find that out, but trust me, you will be bored with a film that only gets worse as it goes along."," A Marriage Story"

Ambitious, but emotionally absent(and inconsiderate, I guess) husband leaves perfect wife behind to go on vital space mission. In both movies, the man is plagued by memories of a deeply flawed father, leaving them emotionally scarred and unable to reciprocate their perfect wives' love.While in Ad Astra, Brad Pitt's character discovers his shortcomings pieces at a time: though memory, experience, and various encounters - here, they forgo all nuance. We simply have a spider companion who directly and endlessly tells Adam Sandler what an ass he is to his wife. But both movies share one emotional theme: fathers suck and their sons are not much better. Relationships are all about men needing to open up more. This is not so bad by itself. But I've seen this in so many movies and TV shows by now it's starting to get tiresome. With all the fancy camera-work, heavy performances, and ambient music, this story still just beats you over the head with it's message without offering anything other than an overused cliché.Other movies in the past have a truly more nuanced approach. Try Solaris(either version), for example. I appreciate the production of this film, really.

Adam Sandler moping about how he's a bad husband for following his lifelong career towards the razors edge of discovery instead of suddenly dropping everything and staying home with his pregnant wife. It's indistinct just how much she knew going into their relationship about his career path, likely intentional because a little thought makes it extremely unlikely that she'd be in any position to object by the time a mission like that is undertaken.The movie is filled with little nitpicks like that, which will drive an actual sci-fi fan crazy. This isn't real sci-fi, it's nonsense. Do they introduce an alien? Sure. Does it's being an alien matter in any way? No, it might as well have been a ghost. In fact, it could be interpreted that it was a hallucination all along when you think about it. Did his being in space matter in any way? No, it could have been any job that caused the husband to be away instead of at home with his wife. Soldier, oil rig worker, some sort of arctic scientist, etc. All of the ""sci-fi"" elements were nonsensical and only served to push the plot in the direction the writer wanted, they didn't make any real sense.This felt like a bad version of Project Hail Mary, if you thought this had potential but failed on an intellectual level I recommend that book."," Space Spider Marriage Counseling"

"64","Spaceman","tingy-64309","9/10","2 March 2024","Spaceman communicates themes of 'awareness' in way not necessarily obvious to those who may just be looking for entertainment. Those viewers with a sense of spirituality ...(universal energy code knowledge)...will see much more. Anosh (...translates as 'Beautiful morning, The name of a star, Eternal, Everlasting, Immortal, Elixir') being represented as a spider like creature asks us to shift our perspective (with multiple eyes) and acknowledge all is connected. The web that is weaved connects all that is. Eight legs also touches on infinity...multiple paths that have no beginning or ending (ending is beginning/ beginning is ending).That Anosh first appears as an aspect physically within Jakub...that our physical sense of self is our universe. All knowledge is held within, and when that knowledge is remembered clearly it is then wisdom. That essence of understanding flows, it cannot be contained..a flickering spark of source...a fragment continually seeking experience. To learn...and remember wisdom that was never misplaced. To not set a sense of control but instead flow with compassion, forgiveness, gratitude....joy. All being as it should.Additional to that we see magenta colour (referenced as purple but it is magenta tones of the spectrum). Magenta represents universal love at its highest level, the colour of the free spirit, Magenta represents universal love at its highest level, the colour of the free spirit. It is contains the passion, power and energy of red, restrained by the introspection and quiet energy of violet. It promotes compassion, kindness and cooperation. The color magenta is a color of cheerfulness, happiness, contentment and appreciation. Again - without spiritual awareness this simple colour choice by the production could easily be overlooked.Sandler, Mulligan and Rossellini play their parts to perfection but if you are just seeking entertainment value much of what is being communicated could easily be missed. Aloneness is never loneliness....we are never alone. Energetic connection never ceases...you just need the vision to acknowledge it.To me this movie is very much in the same theme as 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' and I think the production delay was simply to create a separation so as to fully acknowledge the similarities, but also separation of what is the infinite truth of all that is. The universe. To release near that movie would have been a mistake, it would have been compared for all the wrong reasons.Spaceman will not share clarification with everyone but don't overlook what you cannot see. Look deeper into all the clever incorporated into this movie. Skinny Human, take an opportunity to contemplate emptiness and all that contains. Man space, space man.Recommend without question.

"66","Spaceman","ferguson-6","6/10","1 March 2024","Greetings again from the darkness. Have you hugged a spider today? Adam Sandler has. Well, technically it's his character who does the hugging. Jakub Prochazka, is a Czech astronaut 189 days into his year long mission. He's flying solo on ""the outskirts of Jupiter"" to explore the Chopra cloud which is expected to reveal the beginning of time. Honestly, it feels like a job worthy of more than one man, however, that's what the source material provides. Based on the 2017 book ""Spaceman of Bohemia"" by Jaroslav Kalfar, Johan Renck directs the adapted screenplay by Colby Day. Mr. Renck is not one that jumps to mind when thinking of an Adam Sandler movie. His previous credits include the excellent mini-series ""Chernobyl"", as well as multiple episodes of acclaimed series, ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Bloodline"".The reality is that Adam Sandler is a solid dramatic actor, as evidenced by his roles in PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE (2002), and more recently, THE MEYEROWITZ STORIES (2017) and UNCUT GEMS (2019). In fact, many of us much prefer heavy-drama Sandler to goofy-comedy Sandler. In this latest, he goes low-key extreme. In fact, Jakub is rapidly sinking into depression, though it has little to do with the loneliness and solitude of space. That's right ... it's a woman. His pregnant wife, Lenka (the always stellar Carey Mulligan) is missing and won't communicate with her galactic husband. We know what's going on with her, but the mission Commander (Isabella Rossellini) refuses to tell Jakub due to his fragile mental state. On top of that, his deteriorating spacecraft is preventing him from sleeping properly.Soon, that rickety old space toilet is the least of Jakub's worries. He's sharing the claustrophobic space with a giant talking spider. Jakub is unsure if this is a figment of his imagination or some alien creature. Passively voiced by Paul Dano, Hanus the arachnid initially appears to be a manifestation of Jakub's subconscious, but as time goes on, it appears he's a creature with knowledge of the universe. The low-key vocals from Jakub and Hanus don't generate much excitement for us viewers, but the therapy Hanus provides, allows Jakub to better understand himself ... and also drives Hanus to binge eat. There are no Sandler tantrums or screaming moments ... instead his sad eyes and droopy face tell us much about Jakub.Hanus calls Jakub ""skinny human"" so many times, it feels like that should be the film's title. It gets old pretty quickly. Other supporting work comes from Kunal Nayyar as Jakub's virtual doc, and Lena Olin as Lenka's mother, although the film struggles to give anyone beyond Jakub much definition (including the underutilized Mulligan). It's a bit baffling to look at this cast and associate them with the Czech Republic space program, but it's Hollywood, where the 20-year age cap between Sandler and Mulligan also matters little. The film spent almost three years in post-production for reasons I don't know, but it's safe to say it's one of the better talking spider movies you'll see, yet not one of the finest lonely astronaut flicks.Begins streaming on Netflix on March 1, 2024."," hug a spider"

This realization comes to him as a result of a new friendship he makes with a spider-like alien which suddenly appears on his spaceship and asks inquisitive questions about his relationship to his wife, because this is the only topic that the alien is interested in.

I'm not sure if that's who this character was intended to be or if Adam Sandler is just incapable of being anything more than that in a serious role like this, but I didn't spend much time thinking about it because both he and his wife are boring and unlikable.Slow, pretentious, boring, with literally ZERO redeeming qualities."," Adam Sandler is bad in low budget, low IQ sci-fi"

First things first, I did not start watching this film as an ""Adam Sandler"" movie, but I started to watch ""Spaceman"" as a science-fiction movie. And it is disappointingly pretentious and illiterate.To start with, how come people in charge of a space mission this important could and would have designed a one-man mission? Also, how come they chose a man with no mental strength?I would like to add something at this point for real life as well: if you are going to send someone into space for a one-year, one-man mission, you should not send a husband with a pregnant wife, you should send an introvert who is fine to stay away from other people. One-year, one-man mission is just a piece of cake for them (us).Second part. Production-wise it is a bit less than what we expected from the trailers.

I'm a huge fan of sci-fi but this movie was less about space and more about the character's relationship back on earth. This movie was terrible. The delivery of the dialogue was so long and drawn out. Especially coming from the spider character who talks soooooo sloooooowly, skiiiiiiiny huuuuumaaan! Spaceman tries desperately to be profound but succeeds only in being mind-numbingly dull. I dont mind Sandler taking a crack at a role in a sci-fi flick but I did not find this movie entertaining in any way.It's one thing to make a bad film but what makes it 10 times worse is when there's an upvoting campaign. Why are so many people giving a terrible movie like this one a perfect rating score of 10?!

Just wish this didn't come out before a Project Hail Mary. The similarities are too close but I'm sure once they do the real story people will forget about this film entirely. Sandler did a great job with this and he really carried the film, obviously since he was almost the only one in it, but who would have thought he could do that.

"78","Spaceman","dianaleediehl","9/10","16 March 2024","What a thought-provoking surprise from Adam Sandler! This is the kind of science fiction that focuses on what makes us human from a personal perspective. People who are expecting the same, old sarcastic or bumbling Sandler are going to be disappointed. Likewise, if you are looking for formulaic, fast-paced action with confrontational aliens, don't bother.But if you like to explore the inner faults and flaws of conscious, sentient beings trying to reconcile their strengths with their weaknesses and their personal with their professional lives in a beautifully crafted space drama, this will make you think and make you feel. If you enjoy the prospect of humanity being represented in the cosmos with all the vulnerabilities that give us depth and meaning, then you may enjoy this movie as much as I did.Few science fiction movies probe the deep psychological motivations of its characters, nor do they propose the potential for meaningful connections. Nor do many science fiction movies dare to consider that one's personal life is as important or more important than their external, professional accomplishments. ""Spaceman"" proposes that one's personal life, one's deep memories, and one's boundaries are what define us and how we approach the cosmos as a species and as individuals.Some reviewers suggest that this movie is not really science fiction. I consider this to be science fiction at its best, because it moves beyond the superficial trappings of action/adventure or horror/suspense to combine personal motivations with academic curiosity about the universe we live in. It shows us that the great explorers are mere mortals, as complex and flawed as the rest of us and suggests (spoiler start) that if we do meet other inhabitants of the universe, that they, too, may be as vulnerable and complex. (spoiler end)If I had to summarize the movie in one quick logline, I would say that in ""Spaceman,"" our protagonist is pushed to explore his inner psyche while exploring what he thinks is a fundamentally physical phenomenon that has intersected our solar system."," A thoughtful, deeply layered exploration of what makes us human"

Not sure how the people at the end suddenly got there either. Trying to be arty and I guess it was with a real original Alien vibes in the filming but just very strange.

"80","Spaceman","pdxymmcffv","7/10","13 March 2024","An under-rated movie. Spaceman is a poetic study of loneliness in marriage undergirded with a gentle irony and comic moments occasionally teetering on the sarcastic - we are meant to deride some of the narcissism, while balancing a compassion for the couple's misery, and this is directed with flair. Sandler and Mulligan give completely convincing performances, and the psychoanalytic spider (Hanus, lol) compresses keen insights into obsession, vulnerability and trauma and their consequences within the marriage dyad. Space here functions as the subjective space of psychoanalytic exploration, regression and the emptiness of relational failure. Occasionally the tableaux can't match the desired profundity, leaving us with melodrama or just discordance - but those are rare moments and the visual score coupled with the gravitas of the acting carries the day. It's a charming movie."," Touching, Artful Space Psych"
"81","Spaceman","kaigannon","10/10","9 March 2024","I don't usually cry in movies and much less when it's an Adam Sandler movie. Somehow this movie just really made me see things that even I am doing wrong. I don't know why so many people are so upset with this movie, I'm sorry you didn't get humans killing aliens sci fi because if that's what you wanted you missed the whole point.Adam Sandler represents a lot of men in this movie in the sense that, we all go through things turn us into one big ambitious cold wall. We end up sacrificing those things around us that really matter at an attempt to fulfill this hole we have inside us. We become this distant and cold wall and push everything away trying to reach our goal, and it's not until you reach it that you really realize the goal never mattered. It's family, the friends, and many times our loved ones which we pushed away which are the things that truly matter. We feel lonely but can never accept that it's not the world that's against you, it's you that has put yourself there. And it doesn't matter if hanush (the alien) was a hallucination or not. It represents an inner monologue or maybe a friend who really takes our hand and gives us that push towards the truth that what we were looking for was right there all along."," Beautiful story about self-realization."
"82","Spaceman","avs-07244","9/10","12 March 2024","Most if those who didn't care for the movie are those who find this story of equal value as the story of their female mate/spouse: not worthy of even trying to understand. A man shouldn't have to take their woman seriously or even consider her a person. And then the uncomfortable feeling that everyone can see their selfishnedss will make them even dislike the film. Well done, Johan Renck!Completely generalizing here, this movie is a bit too tough for the modern man (30+). Perhaps in time, when today's frigid world is old fashioned and great grandkids of ours watch the movie, they will consider us today as lesser people for being so petty and small minded to condemn the film. Just like we today condemn and judge the people who engaged in slavery and open misogyny of their family members as well as child labour, and think we're better than that."," Those who find it boring likely share the guilt of the main character"

Hail Mary is being made into a movie with Ryan Gosling. I really feel Rocky from Hail Mary will be a huge fan favorite. I may be biased because it was such a great book!

I've seen far too many here complain about the film because they believed that it was like Interstellar when it absolutely is not.The movie is not really much about space and not really sci fi, instead space acts more like a wall between the main character and his wife. This forces them to think a lot about themselves and eachother, which is the reason for the main characters realization in the end.The movie is about fear, regret and loneliness. If you don't want that and instead just want cool space story with action, then do NOT watch this film. However if you do like the sound of that then I HIGHLY recommend watching this as I absolutely loved it. It is a real shame that so many people blame the movie for their mistake of not choosing an action movie which has led to the bad ratings on this film, but don't let that discourage you from enjoying this beautiful pice of art."," This is not a action movie"

Do not pass seeing this movie!Not action packed, not juvenile humor that one comes to expect from Sandler. It was a captivating story, driven by dialog, feelings, and emotions.Visually stunning!Ultimately, it's a love story. A man on a solo mission to a space anomaly, facing bitter loneliness. Can't tell what's real or imagined in Sandler's mind but the story is a rich tale of one man's journey for what he thought was some great scientific discovery only to find out what he truly wished for he already had back home."," Unexpected Masterpiece!"
"89","Spaceman","cynicaldee","9/10","11 March 2024","Straight off the bat, lemme admit that I dislike Adam Sandler immensely. I don't find him funny at all. I actively avoid most of his movies like the plague. The only movie of his I kinda like is The Waterboy, and that's only because of watching Colonel Sanders get beaned on the scone by a rogue baseball as a 12-year old boy.But here, in his role as lonely Czech astronaut Jakub, he's perfect. His gaunt features and fatigued expressions perfectly match the character, as do his melancholic, sombre, and downright sad mannerisms. Jakub is a tortured soul; a lonely man devoted to his life's work, and Sandler pulls this off effectively and subtly. How, I don't know...As a longtime science fiction fan, I loved this movie. It really resonated with me - and I think therein lies the target audience (bear with me on this). Jakub is unwavering in his dedication to his work - his entire life and essence - and I think that many introverted men (and, indeed, people) addicted to their jobs can identify with him. Sometimes, we fail to see what's truly important until it's too late... just as Jakub does. When work consumes our entire being, and becomes the only driving factor in our lives, the people we love suffer.It's a slow burner for sure, but a beautifully shot and crafted one. His lonely spaceship looks messy and a bit worse for wear, and I loved the 80's aesthetics - all blocky, full of switches and buttons. Industrial. Functional. Nothing flashy. The space scenes are also gorgeous in their colours and splendour, magnificently relaying the awesome beauty of our universe.And the story itself? About a lonely man whose loneliness is entirely self-inflicted, reflecting on how his actions led up to both his lifelong dreams and his deteriorating, rusting relationship? Poignant stuff.Hanus, voiced by Paul Dano, plays a perfectly calm and analytical sentient extraterrestrial spider. I loved how their relationship grew, and how Jakub's outlook on life is directly challenged by Hanus's poetically laconic observations. Everyone needs a Hanus in their life.It's a great film about being a man absolutely dedicated to work - and the wreckage we all leave behind in our pursuit of ambition. Without spoiling much, the revelations Jakub goes through in his retrospections of his relationships and connections are very touching and heartfelt. Often, I feel like your average working married man is sidelined in the zeitgeist of global society (perhaps rightfully so - after all, we've had the spotlight for the last few decades), and that us, as modern men, bottle up all our feelings - our true, raw feelings - and just quietly suffer. It's about time we started speaking about our emotions: our anxieties, our depressions; the constant pressure we feel to have a stiff upper lip and just get on with things. Our hopes and dreams. It's time we started laying bare our vulnerabilities and our fears and our hopes - and bringing those feelings into open conversation, and not being ashamed of them. It's only once our walls are down that we can reconnect with humanity as a whole, and merge into our modern society. With love and understanding and acceptance; casting aside the toxic masculinity that has plagued us for generations.If you're looking for flash and explosions, skip this.If you're looking for beautifully shot scenes and an analysis of the impact a toxic work/life balance can have, don't miss this.It made me cry a little. And then go out and tell the people in my life just how much I truly appreciate them. I hope it does the same for you.I've reviewed this film from a heterosexual introverted work-driven male perspective with a string of failed relationships behind me, but ultimately I feel like this movie can talk to anyone, of any gender and any orientation. All you gotta be is lonely. Or romantic!And may Hanus draw you out of your solitude, and break down your walls, and give you the space you might need to reflect on your connections to all the people in your life. And may you tell all those people just how important they are to you. After all, beyond Jupiter, what actually matters?-1 star for some shaky science though.

"93","Spaceman","nlack-69576","10/10","9 March 2024","Beautiful in its loneliness. Spaceman is sci-fi only in who Sandlers plays off and where. But setting and casting aside, it's a story of loneliness, priorities, love, regret, guilt and more. For me, this is closer to Sam Rockwells Moon movie in the thought provoking themes it's conveys throughout. It's definitely a movie you talk about after discussing what this or that meant. You don't end up loving it. You end up thinking about it. And that, to me, makes it successful.Not all movies can be processed immediately. Some of the best require time to rethink the meanings of scenes, the interactions and more. This one won't be for everyone. The alien spider might just be a character too crazy to accept for some. To me, it felt natural.The low smooth monotone voice of the spider along with the underlying stress inducing and monotonous audio playing softly in the background almost throughout the movie (aka Chris Nolan's Batman and Inception) like intentional tinnitus, was effective in furthering the heightened emotional state of Sandlers character as the movie progressed.I feel after 24hrs, I need to watch again and focus more on the deeper interactions between Hanus the spider and Sandlers Jacob. All in all, it's a very good movie that won't appeal to many due to its slower tempo. If you liked Moon, you likely will like this too."," A very good movie akin to Moon but not for everyone."

The 1980's level tech mixed in with a few modern day items is also interesting.

The entire setting is a setup for the true purpose of the movie, which is exploring the main characters inner struggle. This movie reminded me of interstellar in the fact that both movies conveyed the guilt and regret that comes as a price for being overly ambitious. It pushes the innately human themes of love and the desire for things we currently do not have. In the deep isolation of space the main character finally realizes he left behind what was actually most important to him, what he's been neglecting all this time: his wife.

Spaceman tells this story in a dreamy atmosphere with the help of Hanus. Why a spider? One of the most common fears among people is the fear of spiders.

"101","Dune","96450","10/10","2 March 2024","Adam Sandler does a good job in this drama, but you're probably asking yourself ""Why the spider""? Well, It is the most common fear among people (Arachnophobia). But do you know what are people even more afraid of? Accepting the truths about themselves and being completely honest with yourself. Now, combine all that and you get answers to everything about this, actually decent movie. That is why the spider crawls out of him in his dreams (subconscious), which is the beginning of his transformation and self-learning, self-knowledge. To realize you are selfish, a coward, and victim-mentality, it takes strength, but most of all ""no filters about yourself"". Are you a bad person? Can you go that deep into your mind to fight your demons? Just as a spider (at the beginning) so is self-learning. It is ugly and hard until you finally reach the goal - wanting to and eventually changing your wrong ways and also shedding parts of you (selfishness, bitterness, anger, victim mentality). Most people never reach this transformation, but he did. It started as an ""ugly"" huge spider, one, you later get to love. It is the TRUTH - The truth is ugly at the beginning but eventually, it sets you free, you start to love it, admire it, and learn. The truth about who you are, what, and why you did wrong. It is the ultimate goal and the beginning of a new life to overcome that battle and become fully honest with yourself. IS THE SPIDER REAL? I think not. I think Hanush is not real, it is Adam's (Jakob) projection of his subconscious, guilt, anger, and bitterness, but also all good inside, like love, acceptance, and understanding. That deep need to change what later becomes truth and ultimately the realization of his mistakes. It sets him free to open up and become a selfless, better man. At the same time, he ends battles within, he lets go of guilt, sadness, regret, and bitterness... they are all gone in the nebula, and that is why clear skies open."," Separate, but not quite equal"

"104","Dune","jf191073","5/10","2 March 2024","This screenplay will touch upon more and deeper psychological issues than most viewers are able or ready to explore within their own psyche. Hence, reviews such as, ""it fails to consistently engage with its most interesting ideas."" I.e., one's inward journey into their own psyche is of little to no interest for the average person. And... that is precisely why the Earth is full of problems caused by human infestation -- to quote V-ger (ST:TMP).Movies addressing psychological issues and motifs are gaining traction in the movie industry, and can make quite a profit -- such as Barbie.For the rest of us who are open to considering what lay beyond our inner limitations, this is an absolutely wonderful movie, perfectly juxtaposing innerspace with outerspace, and the cyclical dichotomy of the end being the beginning, at multiple levels. The direction and editing establish an absolutely perfect pace for the premise of solo space travel and introspection, analogous to Silent Running (1972). The set design is remarkably plausible.Last but not least, this is the best performance by Adam Sandler since Punch Drunk Love (2002). And the irony in this movie is that when Sandler overcomes whatever issues keep him from taking on deep and serious roles -- in a manner similar to the character he plays in this movie -- he is absolutely amazing in revealing the gift of his own personal depth.(Minus one star for psychological issues not written by, or without consultation of, psychology experts.)"," Rated Minus 5 On a Scale of 1 to 10"
"105","Dune","tero.lehtinen","8/10","2 March 2024","I understand that a lot of people probably rated this low because they saw that it starred Adam Sandler and came into it expecting Happy Gilmore. I did not. I am a sci-fi enthusiast, and I cut my teeth on some of the great, old masterpieces of the '50s and '60s -- many of them by Czech authors, just like this one was! These novels and films were ones that modern audiences might see as ""dry"" these days, but they were hard-core sci-fi that packed an emotional punch while telling a story of speculative fiction -- a world that ""advanced the timeline"" from our own to see how the human psyche, human morality, human frailty, would cope with advances in technology. And that's exactly what we have here -- a Czech astronaut put in an extraordinary circumstance, even fantastical by the standards of our ""real world."" And yet, the actual story isn't fantastical at all -- it's a simple question of the human heart, and the meaning of life. In that way, it's not so different from a one-act, heavy-dialogue drama... but by framing it as a science fiction film, we can strip out any modern-day distractions and just focus on human nature in its purest form.And maybe enjoy Paul Dano's absolutely riveting performance as a giant arachnid alien!This is a must-see for any lover of ""pure"" sci-fi or ""old-school"" sci-fi. 8/10."," Visually perfect, but too short to understand the plot."

This film is about humanity, what happens when we deny our emotions and turn to empty heroic pursuits. This film is about everything and nothing, time, space and most importantly - the intergalactic appeal of hazelnut chocolate spread. It's also about an incredibly wise, giant spider with cute little teeth.It has a touch of David Lynch about it, especially with the Isabella Rossellini factor. It navigates the uneasy edge of menace and humour, but with a plot that actually makes sense.It also reminded me of eternal sunshine of a spotless mind with the retro fittings, brick phone, and chunky eastern block tech, placing the film both in the future and the past at the same time.Bravo for making a film about space that isn't about space or man's burning ambition to beat the odds. Bravo for making a film that is less than two hours long and never gets boring. Bravo for doing something entirely different and putting two actors together I never thought I'd see in the same frame.After seeing Adam Sandler in Hidden Gems I became a fan, and I'm an even bigger one now, and Carey Mulligan is excellent, as usual. Although I have to say if anything annoyed me in the film it was the age difference between Carey Mulligan's character and her mother. The mother looked perhaps 10 years older than the daughter, max... how's that work...? Same old same old. The reluctance to cast older-looking, age appropriate women in this industry continues...Lots of people won't like this movie. For many reasons. If you're expecting a film about mr big dick beating the odds in a tin can you'll be be sadly disappointed.

It's an enjoyable movie though, I like me some Adam Sandler and I like me some slow sci-fi.

It begins with Adam Sandler as an astronaut traveling towards a mysterious purple cloud to see what's what with that, but instead of a space drama we get a marital drama involving Sandler's character and his pregnant wife (Carey Mulligan in the least interesting performance I've ever seen her give) on Earth who has decided that while he is alone in space is a good time to announce she's leaving him! During this flight the astronaut suddenly has a companion who looks very much like a gigantic multi-legged, multi-eyed speaking spider who may or may not be a hallucination. The spider and the astronaut talk endlessly about a variety of things but mainly his negligence to what matters the most in life, his wife and his life on Earth. Now, one can understand why she would not want to be married to a man who leaves her behind to go out into space, but she kind of signed up for this to begin with so that didn't make much sense to me, especially given it's only a one year trip that he is halfway through. It also didn't make sense to me that the astronaut is so depressed and perhaps hallucinatory after those first 6 months. This seems an awfully short time for an experienced astronaut trained for this to start unraveling. How does it end? Well, you'll have to watch it to find that out, but trust me, you will be bored with a film that only gets worse as it goes along."," New 2006 US Ext. DVD Won't Play Properly"

In both movies, the man is plagued by memories of a deeply flawed father, leaving them emotionally scarred and unable to reciprocate their perfect wives' love.While in Ad Astra, Brad Pitt's character discovers his shortcomings pieces at a time: though memory, experience, and various encounters - here, they forgo all nuance. We simply have a spider companion who directly and endlessly tells Adam Sandler what an ass he is to his wife. But both movies share one emotional theme: fathers suck and their sons are not much better. Relationships are all about men needing to open up more. This is not so bad by itself. But I've seen this in so many movies and TV shows by now it's starting to get tiresome. With all the fancy camera-work, heavy performances, and ambient music, this story still just beats you over the head with it's message without offering anything other than an overused cliché.Other movies in the past have a truly more nuanced approach.

Adam Sandler moping about how he's a bad husband for following his lifelong career towards the razors edge of discovery instead of suddenly dropping everything and staying home with his pregnant wife. It's indistinct just how much she knew going into their relationship about his career path, likely intentional because a little thought makes it extremely unlikely that she'd be in any position to object by the time a mission like that is undertaken.The movie is filled with little nitpicks like that, which will drive an actual sci-fi fan crazy. This isn't real sci-fi, it's nonsense. Do they introduce an alien? Sure. Does it's being an alien matter in any way? No, it might as well have been a ghost. In fact, it could be interpreted that it was a hallucination all along when you think about it. Did his being in space matter in any way? No, it could have been any job that caused the husband to be away instead of at home with his wife. Soldier, oil rig worker, some sort of arctic scientist, etc. All of the ""sci-fi"" elements were nonsensical and only served to push the plot in the direction the writer wanted, they didn't make any real sense.This felt like a bad version of Project Hail Mary, if you thought this had potential but failed on an intellectual level I recommend that book."," Average movie"

"114","Dune","wafxl","10/10","2 March 2024","Spaceman communicates themes of 'awareness' in way not necessarily obvious to those who may just be looking for entertainment. Those viewers with a sense of spirituality ...(universal energy code knowledge)...will see much more. Anosh (...translates as 'Beautiful morning, The name of a star, Eternal, Everlasting, Immortal, Elixir') being represented as a spider like creature asks us to shift our perspective (with multiple eyes) and acknowledge all is connected. The web that is weaved connects all that is. Eight legs also touches on infinity...multiple paths that have no beginning or ending (ending is beginning/ beginning is ending).That Anosh first appears as an aspect physically within Jakub...that our physical sense of self is our universe. All knowledge is held within, and when that knowledge is remembered clearly it is then wisdom. That essence of understanding flows, it cannot be contained..a flickering spark of source...a fragment continually seeking experience. To learn...and remember wisdom that was never misplaced. To not set a sense of control but instead flow with compassion, forgiveness, gratitude....joy. All being as it should.Additional to that we see magenta colour (referenced as purple but it is magenta tones of the spectrum). Magenta represents universal love at its highest level, the colour of the free spirit, Magenta represents universal love at its highest level, the colour of the free spirit. It is contains the passion, power and energy of red, restrained by the introspection and quiet energy of violet. It promotes compassion, kindness and cooperation. The color magenta is a color of cheerfulness, happiness, contentment and appreciation. Again - without spiritual awareness this simple colour choice by the production could easily be overlooked.Sandler, Mulligan and Rossellini play their parts to perfection but if you are just seeking entertainment value much of what is being communicated could easily be missed. Aloneness is never loneliness....we are never alone. Energetic connection never ceases...you just need the vision to acknowledge it.To me this movie is very much in the same theme as 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' and I think the production delay was simply to create a separation so as to fully acknowledge the similarities, but also separation of what is the infinite truth of all that is. The universe. To release near that movie would have been a mistake, it would have been compared for all the wrong reasons.Spaceman will not share clarification with everyone but don't overlook what you cannot see. Look deeper into all the clever incorporated into this movie. Skinny Human, take an opportunity to contemplate emptiness and all that contains. Man space, space man.Recommend without question.

"116","Dune","griffonlianne","8/10","1 March 2024","Greetings again from the darkness. Have you hugged a spider today? Adam Sandler has. Well, technically it's his character who does the hugging. Jakub Prochazka, is a Czech astronaut 189 days into his year long mission. He's flying solo on ""the outskirts of Jupiter"" to explore the Chopra cloud which is expected to reveal the beginning of time. Honestly, it feels like a job worthy of more than one man, however, that's what the source material provides. Based on the 2017 book ""Spaceman of Bohemia"" by Jaroslav Kalfar, Johan Renck directs the adapted screenplay by Colby Day. Mr. Renck is not one that jumps to mind when thinking of an Adam Sandler movie. His previous credits include the excellent mini-series ""Chernobyl"", as well as multiple episodes of acclaimed series, ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Bloodline"".The reality is that Adam Sandler is a solid dramatic actor, as evidenced by his roles in PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE (2002), and more recently, THE MEYEROWITZ STORIES (2017) and UNCUT GEMS (2019). In fact, many of us much prefer heavy-drama Sandler to goofy-comedy Sandler. In this latest, he goes low-key extreme. In fact, Jakub is rapidly sinking into depression, though it has little to do with the loneliness and solitude of space. That's right ... it's a woman. His pregnant wife, Lenka (the always stellar Carey Mulligan) is missing and won't communicate with her galactic husband. We know what's going on with her, but the mission Commander (Isabella Rossellini) refuses to tell Jakub due to his fragile mental state. On top of that, his deteriorating spacecraft is preventing him from sleeping properly.Soon, that rickety old space toilet is the least of Jakub's worries. He's sharing the claustrophobic space with a giant talking spider. Jakub is unsure if this is a figment of his imagination or some alien creature. Passively voiced by Paul Dano, Hanus the arachnid initially appears to be a manifestation of Jakub's subconscious, but as time goes on, it appears he's a creature with knowledge of the universe. The low-key vocals from Jakub and Hanus don't generate much excitement for us viewers, but the therapy Hanus provides, allows Jakub to better understand himself ... and also drives Hanus to binge eat. There are no Sandler tantrums or screaming moments ... instead his sad eyes and droopy face tell us much about Jakub.Hanus calls Jakub ""skinny human"" so many times, it feels like that should be the film's title. It gets old pretty quickly. Other supporting work comes from Kunal Nayyar as Jakub's virtual doc, and Lena Olin as Lenka's mother, although the film struggles to give anyone beyond Jakub much definition (including the underutilized Mulligan). It's a bit baffling to look at this cast and associate them with the Czech Republic space program, but it's Hollywood, where the 20-year age cap between Sandler and Mulligan also matters little. The film spent almost three years in post-production for reasons I don't know, but it's safe to say it's one of the better talking spider movies you'll see, yet not one of the finest lonely astronaut flicks.Begins streaming on Netflix on March 1, 2024."," Best one out there"

It's an alien friendship movie but with the lack of companionship that Enemy Mine (I spit on your Mickey Mouse!) had.

I'm not sure if that's who this character was intended to be or if Adam Sandler is just incapable of being anything more than that in a serious role like this, but I didn't spend much time thinking about it because both he and his wife are boring and unlikable.Slow, pretentious, boring, with literally ZERO redeeming qualities."," Waste of my time"

This seems to be important: Nearly everybody who read the book first hates the movie, but most of those who saw the movie first seem to like it.Now, why is this so? I cannot really understand it because, in comparition to other movies based on existing literature, what we have here is a film which stays very close to the original story and does not add many new elements.When I read the book, I could see the movie in front of me in nearly every chapter. So I really don't understand what Herbert-Fans had expected from this movie...I for my part like it a lot. It has a very mystical atmosphere about it and the story develops nicely. Of course there are some elements which are simply not explained and are therefore very confusing, but somehow this seems to be a thing Lynch tends to do in every of his movies, so what? I like some simple scenes like the opening monologue a whole lot. I LOVE the music (which played in my mind all the time while I read the book), and I think the characters are very strong and (for example Letho Atreides) sometimes full of tragedy.The part I like the most though is the worm-part. I think the special effects are not always brilliant, but seeing the scenes with the worms, I am really awestruck because they are so impressing.All in all, I think this is one of the more underrated movies in Science Fiction history. It may be because the director himself was not happy with it, or because fans expected too much from a simple two hour movie. I always enjoy watching this film and listening to the soundtrack.

In that sense, Lynch focussed on the world-building too much (Can't help thinking today it would be No.1 of 3 or 4 movies) Maybe that was his intention?Don't get me wrong, I loved the AI spectacle of the 2021 version...but it lacked something intangible. It seemed the story-telling played second fiddle to the AI gorgeousness.

I read the book again when I was 60+ and while I still like it, it isn't as good as I remember.In my opinion the 1984 movie is better, so far. The 2nd part of the new Dune movie hasn't come out yet, so it is still possible the new one will be better. The new movie has nice cinematography but is lacking in character development. I am also disappointed by the exclusion of Shadout Mapes, she is an impressive part of the 1984 movie. The new movie is basically background with most of the interesting things coming in the 2nd movie.I really enjoyed the 1984 movie, but I did have friends who couldn't understand it. I assume that is because they were not into SciFi or didn't read the book first. Books are almost always better than movies, so my mind may have automatically filled in what was missing in the movie. But, the movie did have some things that weren't in the book, such as Paul's ability to use his voice as a weapon without the Weirding Module at the end of his fight with Sting which I thought was a nice touch.Overall I really think the 1984 movie was quite good and did a good job of representing the movie. Although, I do wonder if I would think it was so good if I hadn't read the book before watching the movie. At the time it came out several of my friends thought it was difficult to follow which may explain why it wasn't a commercial success."," So far (2023) still the best Dune movie!"
"131","Dune","Oceans17","9/10","23 July 2007","Lynch's creative imagination gives a film with a high rate of intense images per square inch of celluloid, beginning with two consecutive solemn scenes: a brief introduction with an impressive Virgina Madsen as Princess Irulan and narrator of what we are about to see, and the vision of a desert where the wind blows with an epic music.Intensity does not decay, as we found ourselves in an operatic exaggeratedly luxurious palace, the center of an already decadent empire, where very fine actors like José Ferrer and Siân Philips are dressed in spectacular dresses and matching wits with an octopus-like space- time navigator (and all that in less than a few minutes, compressing many pages of Frank Herbert's book).If that's not original enough for you, perhaps you should wait until a giant worm that causes mega-volts of static in the desert sand swallows a huge harvesting machine, or until you see a long row of men on the dunes waiting for an even greater worm and an aspiring messiah to confirm a prophecy in a mysterious death-defying ritual.If you think that stories are excuses to create powerful images, specially in a widescreen, that long row of men standing in the desert (while Paul walks towards his dangerous future) should not disappoint you, even if you are not a fan of Frank Herbert (I am not). As an image, it is one of the most powerful and cinematographically beautiful that I have seen. Lynch is to be credited for such a vision.Plus an endless list of top quality actors like Francesca Annis, Max Von Sydow, Linda Hunt or Dean Stockwell to name a few, wonderful characterizations (Jurgen Prochnow is just the right actor for Duke Leto Atreides, or Lynchian Everett McGill for Stilgar) and of course Kyle MacLachlan as the charismatic heir that becomes hard-boiled leader.9 out of 10 for a film with enough ideas and emotions to fill many films. A friend of mine had ""Dune"" as the only film in his VHS video collection: I bet he left the tape inside the VHS player and eventually broke the ""eject"" button."," A beginning with Virginia Madsen can not fail"

Even taking into account that making a movie about Frank Herbert's classic novel was a monumental task, David Lynch deserves so much credit for this production. It was visually stunning, impactful, true to the novel, and directed by a genius. I feel that it was huge for Dune fans and non Dune fans.The amount of bile directed at this movie should be ignored.

"134","Dune","simenkv","9/10","29 November 2002","I have always been a David Lynch-fan, but was nervous to see this movie at last: The film has the reputation of being perhaps Lynch' weakest film. I don't get it, that people say this.The movie is visually strong, the plot is strong (of course; being a close adaption of Frank Herbert's masterpiece), it has (mostly) great performances (Kenneth McMillan as the baron Harkonnen, for instance) and the music (by Toto) is also top notch.I think maybe why people dislike Dune is that they don't understand what kind of movie they are seeing: It is not action, not space opera, it is not drama and it is (in some ways) not a ""typical"" David Lynch movie. The story is very strong, has some heavy implications when it comes to humanity and maybe identity, and tries to do something that seldom is done on film. (In my opinion.) This is science fiction as it is supposed to be.I won't say too much. (Probably someone else has said what I wanted to before me.) My advice: Go see the movie and do not expect Star Wars, and do not expect Blue Velvet. Feel the movie instead of comparing it to some other flick.I gave it 9 out of 10, which i rarely do. I will see this movie over again right away; there is so much to absorb in one watch."," Excellent adaption of Herbert's Dune."

"137","Dune","lostonthehighway","9/10","26 March 2021","I have read Frank Herbert's incredible novel twice, which I think is my favourite book of all time, and I went into this with mixed expectations after seeing it hailed as Lynch's only failure. However, I just don't understand all of the criticism.I liked it. That is the first and foremost point I would like to make. I'm well aware that Lynch took considerable creative liberties whilst making this, but I think that the film still had the feel and style of the book. David Lynch's gritty, textured science fiction world meshes perfectly with Dune's unique atmosphere.Of course some plot lines were cut: you have almost 600 pages of material here. I was never expecting everything from the novel to make it onto the screen. However, I think that there was a pretty well-done transition between the book and this - the movie felt similar to what I envisioned it to be in my head as I as reading. It would have been even better if Lynch was allowed to make a trilogy, or even just two films, as that would convey Dune in its entirety. It really is frustrating, because such an ambitious and possibly incredible vision was just messed with in the hands of the studio.I mean, I read the book before watching it, so I didn't really have any problems following along. However, I totally understand why people didn't get it - Dune is a colossal epic and this film only really scratches the surface. So I definitely recommend first giving the book a thorough read beforehand so you have the best experience.Now for the thing that stood out to me the most whilst watching Dune: the effects. The number one problem directors encountered in the 1970s and 1980s is the lack of technology needed to create sci-fi environments such as the once in Dune. However, this is so perfectly achieved here that I was completely blown away. I mean, I'm not saying that the effects were completely flawless, there were a few sliiiightly questionable moments, but for the most part - especially the sandworms - were incredibly done. Some of the effect haven't aged that well, but Dune is a perfect example of an old science-fiction film that poured heart and soul into the effects. Not to sound annoying, but something really isn't the same about modern CGI as opposed to the intricate hand-made miniatures. This film, as well as 1982's Blade Runner, redefined the sci-fi neo-noir genre.I'm revisiting my opinions on this after having been caught in the Dune-craze following Villeneuve's film. In fact, I watched this a second time the day before I headed off to the cinema to watch it. And Villeneuve's Dune really was a modern science fiction epic for the modern age, but there are still some things which I prefer in Lynch's Dune. It's been almost 40 years since this first came out, and of course the visual effects have gotten significantly better, but there's still an almost too-sanitised feel to Villeneuve's version. I really loved the messy, campy, disgusting and industrial world of Lynch's Dune, and in my opinion Kyle MacLachlan gave a much better performance than Timothée Chalamet.This film is weird. I mean, it's David Lynch, so I was expecting strangeness, but this, combined with Herbert's world, is a level of camp I thought couldn't feasibly be achieved. But having such a beautifully bizarre masterpiece is thousands of times better than having another mindless, CGI-fest Marvel movie. This was the first of Lynch's films that I ever watched (I know, maybe not off to the strongest start) and it made me check out his many other masterpieces, so listen to me when I mean that this is a GOOD FILM.In conclusion, watch this movie. Read the book, then watch it. Does not deserve any of the hate it receives.-Sasha."," Why does everyone hate this?"

I think this is one of the more underrated movies in Science Fiction history. It may be because the director himself was not happy with it, or because fans expected too much from a simple two hour movie.David Lynch famously brought his ""Dune"" vision to the screen in 1984. The film score for Dune was composed by the Rock group TOTO their first and only film score .

I am pointing this out as If one is not familiar with lore of Dune ,Lynch's film despite what critics and some fans may have said about the effort ; I personally think it is excellent ""a film that gives LSD hallucinations without taking LSD.""My favorite aspect, the visuals, absolutely breathtaking ! Lynch's version is a great starting point even though liberties were taken ; to learn the lore and charterers penned in Herbert's novel.Hardly a cohesive experience (Vintage Lynch) but individual scenes are brought to life with striking power.

"141","Dune","tomalakis","9/10","15 May 2023","And that's how it can turn out when you take up a subject you not only haven't loved since childhood, but after finishing the film you actually hate it... I'm not giving a near-full rating because Lynch's Dune is nearly perfect - far from it - but because, unlike recent clueless attempts by Hollywood executives and market analysts, it's not only a better film, but mainly because it's actually a FILM - with a head and a heel, a beginning and an end, and something substantial in between, with characters of blood, milk and pus, with a healthy dose of properly hallucinogenic material and because it comes the closest of all attempts to Herbert's Dune (as much as you may dislike it) and not only manages to at least sort of pull off what others have completely broken their teeth on, but even still has the strength and the amazing audacity to throw LYNCH'S Dune on top of everything (even if only partially) and get away with it. And don't be fooled when Lynch tells you it's his worst film, because what he means is that he could make it even crazier... And that's something that deserves such a high rating - now more than ever... What's the farthest from perfect here are Baron and Paul (who haven't worked for anyone yet, and will always be the biggest challenge) and basically the entire second half (which, unlike the first part, is not as rewarding cinematically, as it's mostly about Paul's painful and complex transformation into the ultimate blockhead - which can be left out at worst, as happened here). Because let's kindly pour ourselves some clear wine: Lynch did everything he could realistically do with Dune in two hours and in 1984."," It has the audacity!"
"142","Dune","Dr_Coulardeau","9/10","9 January 2007","That film is a superb adaptation of Frank Herbert's first novel of his Dune series. We could of course harp a lot about the symbolism of names, the Fremen being free men, and the Harkonnen having a Germanic name, and the Atreides having a Greek sounding name, and the Emperor having an Arab name, and we could also add that the witches, the Bene Gesserit have a Latin sounding name, etc. We could also said that the name of the hero, Muad'dib also sounds Arabic, or is it Hindi, though the frequent aspirated 'h' of this latter language is absent from this writing and pronouncing. But that is superficial and the worst name and being is not present in this film and book, the real Arabs, the Sligs, the hybrid of a giant slug and a pig, who are the direct reflection and mirror image of the caricature of the sly Arab living by the sharia so common in the West. What is interesting in this volume and film is the political intrigues along with the prophetic dimension of the plot. The political intrigues revolves around the Greek sounding Atreides, the honest ones from a planet of oceans and rain; the Germanic sounding Harkonnen, the rotten (actually rotting) polluting industrial ones who are violent, vicious and sadistic, slightly vampiristic too; the Persian sounding Emperor Shaddam, bringing together the Shah of Iran and all the Saddams of the Arab world; the Spacing Guild that controls the universe by controlling travelling in that universe; and finally the Fremen, an underground free species of human beings who believe in a prediction of a Messiah and are mostly invisible on the planet Dune. The Bene Gesserit is also present with their plan to produce the perfect new Messiah, God, Savior through genetic manipulations by guiding the reproductive schemes among the powerful from whom the Messiah can only come. He will nevertheless come for sure, but by accident and thanks to the alliance of Paul Atreides, the last representative of the Atreides House, his Bene-Gesserit-trained mother and the Fremen. Some will see in it the caricature of the world in the Cold War. Of course we have to know one thing that is not immediately clear: the fact that this world is the heir of the Butlerian Jihad that destroyed all thinking machines and then banned the construction of such machines, forcing human beings to develop their skills at calculating and thinking to keep the control over things. But this vision is slightly short. It goes beyond and it reaches the level of a reflection on what politics are: a fight among a very few superior leaders who are essential born as such and vaguely accepted by some managing more than governing council. Democracy is the value that is totally absent from this story. Even the Fremen are not democratic since they believe in a supreme leader, a messiah, and their actions are mostly mass-reactions, extremely collective methods of governing and controlling their own people. That future world then will not be different from the old feudal world of six or seven centuries ago. The people, the mass of people necessary for those constant wars and feuds, are nothing but pawns that die on the screen and in the sand of Dune without any kind of concern for their lives or even simply life. They are non-entities, including on the winning side of the Fremen. That world is dehumanized and does not defend any kind of ideal or principle. The film is perfect though with its special effects and its immense cosmic and desertic scenery. The film is very dense and thus the suspense is quite effective. The film then is nothing but an action film with good situations and interesting characters, be they heroes or be they monsters. This vision of the world remains rather primitive though and maybe even lower than what could be normal expectations. It satisfies though the desire for survival and victory over danger that lurks in the circumvolutions of the human brain. That's probably why this film, and the books behind, still have a positive life in our culture. Messianic characters and situations contrasted to apocalyptic treachery will always be a favorite of the human mind.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"," Beautiful vision of an archaic feudal world in the distant future"

The storyline follows an evil emperor who takes advantage of a planets inhabitants and takes their resources to fuel space travel. When the son of a new leader of the planet sees the ways of the local people he decides to join them to overthrow the emperor.This movie is directed by David Lynch (Mulholland Drive) and stars Kyle MacLachlan (Show Girls), Virginia Madsen (Candyman), Leonardo Cimino (Monster Squad), Francesca Annis (Krull), Brad Dourif (Child's Play), Everett McGill (Silver Bullet), Patrick Stewart (X-man) and Sting (Cold Mountain).The storyline for this is very intricate and contains great characters, setting and circumstances that really capture the imagination. The cast is brilliantly selected and the special effects are way better than they should be for 1984. I am always thoroughly impressed by the space special effects, the worms and the sets. They paid so much attention to detail on the makeup, attire and various props.This really was a great movie. There's a lot to absorb and keep up with, but this is definitely worth your time.

Otherwise sane and reasonable individuals start foaming at the mouth and twitching uncontrollably when recollecting the 15 minutes they managed to sit through. Others start screaming obscenities and become unable to articulate sentences to describe their loathing of this movie. I've yet to meet anybody who DIDN'T think it one of the worst movies ever made. Why is it, then, that I love it? 'Dune' is one of my favorite movies. I have watched it several dozen times and never tire of it. Despite De Laurentiis's butchering of both Lynch's screenplay, and the original cut of the movie, enough of the Director's signature style remain for his fans, with many moments that are pure Lynch; bizarre and disturbing  the heart plugs, the caged cat, the weird incestuous homoerotic undertones, the muddled dream sequences. The entire thing is beautifully crafted with genuine Baroque excess. The production design is breathtaking, with a rare sense of new worlds being created and given their own aesthetic. Every character, though thoroughly over-the-top, is original and memorable, with Brad Dourif, Freddie Jones, Linda Hunt and Sian Phillips being particular favourites.I'm not sure why so many people find this movie so unwatchable.

I read the original Dune trilogy and so I realized that so much was missing, and there were odd little additions that were in the film but not in the books, which mostly were not effective. I just watched this same Dune on DVD and am impressed that the look is still very acceptable, unlike other films whose production styles ages them badly. I appreciated the movie more for what it was, which is more of a Readers' Digest Dune. A lot of important characters are marginalized in the film, and several notable scenes are missing. A film that had more of the detailed world of Dune and all of its characters would take 6-8 hours. The Harkonnens are overdone and overacted but you do get the idea that they are despicable.

After the initial scene, the pace slowed quite a bit but eventually picked back up. Angela brought the drama like only Angela can but I wish she had bigger parts. Also, it's not too clear why she was sent to marry given all the time they had to explain it. Still a good watch."," Enjoyed!"
"159","Damsel","nic959","5/10","9 March 2024","In the realm of fantasy and adventure, expectations often soar high, especially when a promising young talent like Millie Bobby Brown is at the forefront. Unfortunately, ""Damsel,"" Netflix's latest foray into the genre, falls significantly short of those expectations, stumbling on several fronts that detract from its potential.First and foremost, Brown's performance in ""Damsel"" is a contentious point. Known for her ability to bring depth and nuance to her roles, Brown seems to miss the mark here, delivering a portrayal that leans towards overacting. While her commitment to the role is evident, the excessive expressiveness detracts from the authenticity of her character, especially in scenes that demand subtlety and restraint.Moreover, the film's attempt to maintain a polished aesthetic for Brown's character, even in the most rugged settings, feels incongruous. Whether she's exploring a dark, damp cave or engaging in a fierce battle with a dragon, her makeup remains immaculate, a choice that undermines the realism and immersion of the narrative. Such details might seem minor, but they accumulate, pulling the audience out of the story and highlighting a lack of attention to context and continuity.The script and writing of ""Damsel"" are other areas where the film falters. The narrative feels underdeveloped, with dialogues and plot progressions that often lack the depth and complexity one would expect from a genre rich in possibilities. This issue is not confined to Brown's character alone; the overall cast delivers performances that range from passable to mediocre, suggesting that the problem lies more with the material they were given rather than their individual talents.While the actors, including Brown, show moments of potential, their efforts are hampered by the film's lackluster script and direction. It's a classic case of a movie that could have been much more, had the writing and character development been given the attention they deserved.In conclusion, ""Damsel"" is a disappointing addition to Netflix's lineup, particularly given the streaming giant's capacity for producing compelling content. While it might offer a few entertaining moments, the film ultimately feels like a missed opportunity to deliver a captivating, coherent fantasy adventure. Viewers might find themselves watching till the end, but more out of a sense of completion than genuine enjoyment."," Damsel: A Missed Opportunity by Netflix"
"160","Damsel","natetyner-81077","6/10","10 March 2024","This is a film that attempts to weave a tale of a princess being used as a sacrifice to appease the wrath of a dragon, but ultimately falls short in delivering an engaging and innovative storyline. The plot unfolds in a disappointingly predictable manner, with twists and turns that can be seen from a mile away. In fact, the word ""generic"" doesn't even begin to describe the lack of originality in the narrative.Throughout the film, the audience is taken on a journey that feels like a rehash of countless other fantasy adventures. The characters, plot points, and resolutions all feel like recycled elements from mid-level storytelling, leaving little room for surprises or genuine emotional investment.While the film may hold some appeal for a younger audience who may not have been exposed to a wide range of films over the years, it fails to offer anything new or compelling for more seasoned viewers. For those accustomed to the rich tapestry of storytelling found in cinema, ""Damsel"" may come across as little more than background noise - a forgettable addition to the fantasy genre that lacks the spark of creativity needed to truly captivate its audience.In conclusion, ""Damsel"" is a film that struggles to break free from the constraints of its own predictability. While it may find a place among those seeking a simple and straightforward fantasy tale, it ultimately fails to leave a lasting impression or offer anything of substance to those looking for a more engaging cinematic experience."," Meh...

It does everything better than this movie. Better writing, better story, better acting, and in my opinion better action and visual effects.The premise of this movie seemed interesting, and there are parts that I enjoyed, but as a whole I would not watch it again. I think the weakest part really was the writing. The dialogue in most scenes wasn't very good, and the structure/pacing of the movie didn't keep me interested. Even the ending wasn't very satisfying.Watching this also made me think of ""The Princess"", a movie about a captured damsel who has to fight her way through her captors. That movie had HORRIBLE dialogue, but at least the action was fun.

Why not 3 children?

She chose to accept the marriage to save her people and was even smitten by the prince - hints at the dad knew she'd be sacrificed but came back because he couldn't live giving her up and died trying to save her - The biggest ""injustice"" would be the king attacking the eggs (which only god knows how the dragon would know it was her ""daughters"" and thus demanded daughters to be sacrificed) and the prince being deceitful, which was by the queen's order but that is not even misogyny, that's being a Vilan of a script! - which consumed about 30% of screen time for no apparent reason because she wasn't, by textbook definition, oppressed otherwise she wouldn't be a brave, intelligent, opinionated, strong woman - 5/10last 30 mins were ""ok how do we make this work?"" definition of lazy writing - dragon all of the sudden no longer had smell scent, her fire was nerfed 10 times fold where before it was making it rain fire... and let me get this right, a dragon who spits fire... who is not resistant to fire?

A lethal chasm that everybody survives when tossed into. Razor sharp crystals that can be climbed by tying rags to the hands and feet. Especially grievous is the heinous ignorance of dragon biology. Everybody knows dragons are immune to fire, certainly their own fire. This is really nothing more than 2024 teen drama and sadly MBB can't save it. Not even Robin Wright can convince me to forgive the shortcuts and just plain laziness of the screenwriting.

Overall, as others have commented, it's not terrible but it's not great either. The problem is they really don't leave anything up to the viewer to figure out and everything in this film is very predictable. It's a fantasy film so we can't talk about believable here but I feel it could've been done a lot better. There are also some things that are just plain stupid, and really could've been avoided - the use of the blade in the dress, climbing with a crown, using a broad sword twice the size of herself... she goes from struggling to being superhuman - it really just spoils it. I don't wanna ruin the movie for you, but the ending was really a huge disappointment as well - guess they wanted a big finish - again so predictable and totally unnecessary. Would have been better if the retribution was more focused. The antagonist being only one person seems kind of off and they could've made use of the people in the red robes a bit more and developed that - the mother son combo just didn't seem really evil or especially villainous."," 5 stars is pretty good for this"
"166","Damsel","elisetran-56002","10/10","14 March 2024","First of all, Millie B. B was the perfect actress for this powerful role. As a teenage girl, this movie was so beautiful. Not only was the special effects done nicely, but the message this movie sends is done amazing. The moral of this movie is that woman are strong and independent, we are smart and elegant. Elodie starts the movie by saying this is not a movie where damsel in distress (woman in dager) is saved by a prince. Through this movie we get to understand that quote, the prince is a total wuss and the innocent ""princesses"" are smart and saves themself.

The acting was 99% I found Millie Bobby Brown to be an excellent actress for the part. She was the most lovable in my opinion. But as in real life there are faults to us all. As well as in this movie. I found the characters to all have the moral dilemmas of their own. Which made for excellent pay off when resolved.I think whoever rates a movie like this a 1 star has an alt motive. My parents and friends all liked it and rated it an 8 at least. We are very picky as well. It does drag on in the middle where she is in the cave. But for me, it redeemed itself closer to the end. This was where you don't want to miss the details. I love how everything unfolded naturally and they used a lot of ""show don't tell"" so if you're a fan of this style where a main character is a selfless heroine you'll enjoy this movie.People who rated this 1 star are people who probably would rate it 10 if it was a male lead. Like I'm sorry but why does this being a strong woman lead make this left? Don't bring politics into my movies boys. I give the 1 star ratings one star. They just political. Why can't we enjoy movies anymore without politics! Millie Bobby Brown is an excellent actress for her age too!! She was only 18 or 19 when this was filmed. So good!

No such thing can be found in a fairytale where the good always wins over the bad since Disney started changing Brothers Grimm tales.

This is truly a most mediocre movie, a more or less soulless rehash of well-known and overused stories, woven together without much skill and intelligence, creativity. Anyway, Damsel is like too many movies these days - produced, directed, and written by people without any heart for the art of movie-making. It's no more art but work. What else?

I was a little surprised they killed a black knight,but he was a man so I wasn't too surprised.They wrote the dragon trying to be exactly like smaug, except stupid since she could have killed the girl a few different times. The message of underestimating women was very clear although I'm sure the writers thought they were being clever and subtle.The acting was terrible and over the top. The only actress that was convincing at all was the evil queen and the girls father, although there roles were so small that maybe they only seemed ok because they didn't have enough screen time to mess it up.The only thing this movie had going for it was that the main character didn't just breeze through.

You could cut out first 20 minutes of the film and jump right into her being thrown into the pit after the wedding ceremony. At least you'd have some mystery to unravel while watching. Instead, by that time, you're one-third into the runtime it's obvious who's good, who's bad, who's gonna be punished in the end. What is left is the ""dragon part"" of the movie.Said dragon magically changes size several times throughout the viewing experience. In one scene it fills the whole cave, in another it's a size of the elephans, in another it looms over half a castle. A little indicator that they didn't care enough to make even obvious things consistent.Dragon itself is not even inteligent or interesting enough. It's just angry and a bit dangerous. When it almost has its prey in its grasp it decides to go away for one reason or another, giving Elodie room to progress with the plot. Dragon is not defeated, outsmarted or subdued. It doesn't make sense. Whole conclusion to the story is lackluster at best. Some of the dialogues are cringe instead of emotional and inspiring. Watched it with my wife last night and this movie had our eyes rolling on more than one occassion. We really couldn't wait for it to finish so we can watch something else.I think it might be targetted to a younger audience, but then there's a scene where a flock of birds is basically burned alive while flying away from the dragon, which is unnecessarily cruel for a kids movie.If you're an adult with half a brain you should probably skip this one."," Dull, predictable and cringe"

It reminded me a little of 2008's Journey to the Center of the Earth in how imaginative it gets visually.The design of the dragon is splendidly ferocious. Her voice and dialogue contribute to her menacing presence. Millie Bobby Brown exudes confidence and determination and gives us a character we can put confidence in.I like that this is a grittier film than it could have been. No unnecessary humor. It takes itself seriously and gives us some good PG-13 violence and dragon action!"," Fun Fantasy Escapism"
"189","Damsel","casperlei0324","2/10","9 March 2024","They tried to make it looks like a grand fantasy film but I guess the budget was only enough to render the dragon. The ""army"" of the king to slay the dragon were less than 20 people, the ""royal wedding"" had less guests than my friend's wedding. The whole setting just fall short.The acting was ok, was not expecting a Rambo movie but that's pretty much what you get. (Rambo was much much better BTW)The plot was very stupid, mostly because how stupid they make the dragon is. The royal family had been throwing in hundreds of ladies with all kind of ethnicity from European, African, to Asians into the pit as sacrifice, but the dragon never figured out they are not real Royal families...And there are many other parts how the dragon behave just makes absolutely no sense.Nicely rendered dragon and the fire it breaths though, that's how the movie gained an extra star to make it two stars for me. Rest of the CG background looks pretty fake and can tell is obviously green screened."," If you expect any intillengence from the plot or the dragon, stay away. away"
"190","Damsel","johanSweHK","2/10","8 March 2024","This movie progresses so slowly that you can fall asleep and wake up and it's still the same scene.It's so slow you can pause the movie and you won't be able to tell the difference.I can't think of a single memorable moment this movie provided.It's so ultra generic in every conceivable way. If you have seen as much as a poster for any other fantasy movie then you have seen everything this movie has to offer. Infact looking at a ""Lord of the rings"" poster for 5 hours would probably be more rewarding than enduring the 1.5 hours of Demsel.As others have pointed out you know exactly what will happen at any given point in the movie, the plot and the characters are so unbelievably predictable. So if you are looking for something new and innovative this is absolutely not the movie you want to watch.Spoiler she apparently decided to leave her sister in the cave at the end, because who cares about the plot? Apparently nobody who was involved in making this turkey."," The only person in distress is the ones realizing they have another 1 hour 47 min left to watch."
"191","Damsel","carlcasso","8/10","10 March 2024","I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as I was sure it was made for kids.I was very wrong .This is a really good action movie and Millie does a really good job as the lead character .It's beautifully shot and the wide shots of the landscape are breathtaking.The effects are very good and the Dragon is really well Animated.The movie is really quickly paced and there are no dull moments trough out the storyline .Robin Wright does a convincing job as the evil Queen and Ray Winston is not bad as the father .This is really worth a watch and you will enjoy it.It will defiantly have a sequel and I hope they do just as good a job on that ."," Why the bad reviews ?"
"192","Damsel","hallak65","4/10","8 March 2024","And again a new wave girl power movie, where male characters are useless, (the villain king has a single line), the main character is clever, strong, and skilled without any exposition as to why and the main villainess' only sin is she wants to protect her family and people. And the solution for all is revenge. Lovely message.We need a new Ripley or Sarah Connor and not somebody who cuts her own hair for rope when there are so many armor straps around...The only good thing was Shohreh Aghdashloo's voice acting. That voice is a national treasure. Only that's why the movie is worth 4 /10 and not less. Again a new Netflix movie that nobody will watch twice."," When you need a strong female character, she need to cut her own hair"
"193","Damsel","arcadia-56707","5/10","8 March 2024","Oddly paced, choppy story and lame script. You can guess the plot about 2 mins in but it takes the movie 38 more minutes to get there.... Then it's another hour wandering around a cave while the disparate pieces of plot - seemingly slapped together by ChatGPT - try and assemble a coherent premise.Spoiler alert / it doesn't.The movie makes little sense and stinks of a contractual obligation to pump anything out.Milly Bobby brown does a good job with what she's given - which isn't much - but it's not a film you would ever watch again. It'll probably trend on Netflix as number 1 - which shows people will watch anything."," Slow, dull, predictable"
"194","Damsel","hazard111","8/10","8 March 2024","Just from the trailer you could tell there's nothing innovative some would say they called the ending of the show and I'd have to agree. It's a female lead with castles, pretty dresses, and a dragon. A badass princess is always appealing. Plot is thin and simple. It's like riding a rollercoaster you rode before, you already know the bumps and twists but it still gets your heart racing.I like Millie's acting here. She carries the scene even alone. Though I do lament that there's not enough scenes with the side characters to establish more from them. I did tear up in one scene but perhaps that's me being easily pulled by emotional goodbyes.The highlight to me, aside for Millie, was the dragon. The Dragon was perfection. The visuals were great I didn't have any trouble seeing anything even during dark moment. The ending was both satisfying yet lacking...like I wanted more? There's some wonky moments but yeah overall it's actually a fun watch. It's no masterpiece, doubt it'll win any awards but it's a damn good show to relax to if you want something kickass.Warning: There's fair amounts of gruesome wounds."," 'Ready or not' but with a dragon"
"195","Damsel","josdavid-02089","1/10","9 March 2024","This plot is a forced script on survival. There is absolutely no context on how the main character goes from barely surviving the plot to suddenly transforming into Rambo's and Sonja's love child. She is forever protected my multiple events that should have killed her and essentially is always unscathed no matter what happens, all whilst looking fabulous cause the actress is Netflix's diva? There are some poorly written ""empowering"" lines for this character thats protected by possibly the worst written plot.It's more than stupid. Please save your time and do not watch this. It's ridiculously infuriating.Garbage movie. Garbage writing. Garbage plot. Garbage acting. Garbage direction."," Garbage movie."
"196","Damsel","qfazhava","3/10","9 March 2024","I'm not a target audience for this film but I still watched it out of curiosity. I wanted to know in what direction will Millie go this time, but she went the same way. It feels like all of her Netflix movies are the same and yes you can argue about genres and plot but with Enola and now this all of her characters are very, almost impossibly strong and unbeatable no matter in what circumstance they are under. The characters that she plays are way too same and unrealistic. This is not to upset Millie or her fans. I think Millie is very talented, but she also has to be open for more diverse and complex roles. The movie was okay, I guess, I think younger girls will enjoy it more."," Millies characters are the same"
"197","Damsel","simengul","2/10","11 March 2024","I had such a high expectation, but like all other ""newly modern made"" movies it falls apart in under 10-15 minutes.The cameo role from Ray Winstone keeps the movie alive in the begginng, before it turns into a comedy of a cgi / makeup movie.A movie that is supposed to be thousand of years back in time, suddenly have flawless makeup of every girl in the story.A little 20year old girl battles dragons, climbing ""mount Everest"" with her bare hands and uses a broken crown for climbing.Wielding a sword that weighs more than herselfThe cgi is so obvious and overwhelming that it feels like you are watching a cartoonNo, I'll put this movie in the same box as the Marvels movies for the past 10-15 years.Bad screenplay, acting, makeup, story and a big cgi mess.Another big opportunity lost......"," 2/10 just because of Ray Winstone"
"198","Damsel","j-ashley-howell","4/10","9 March 2024","I am a fantasy movie type of person and a huge Ray Winstone fan, but this movie is such a waste of his talent and even more so for Angela Bassett.It's as you would expect for a Princess / Dragon movie you can tell what will happen in the first five minutes and then it becomes dull and predictable.Millie Bobby Brown is OK but for me she is a one dimensional she is the same in every movie she's been in and it's unfortunate, she does not seem to want to challenge herself and so picks movies where she don't have to try to hard.The CGI is good and the dragon is well designed, but the movie is not the best but it will kill a little time whilst your waiting for something beeter to come on.In finishing don't expect too much from this movie and you won't be disappointed, if you want to watch a fantastic princess / dragon show watch Game of Thrones."," Just as you'd expect"
"199","Damsel","mikaelmadsen1981","2/10","10 March 2024","I skipped this movie until I saw a few comments on Facebook that were positive. Oh boy, should have skipped it. The best part about the movie is the last minute. Everything up to that point is a female protagonist that screams and cries more than actual sentences. Millie's character is boring with an over the top character progression that makes no sense at all. There's also Netflix's typical killing of innocent animals that does nothing to the story.There are some weird obvious mistakes in the movie, like serious burns that just disappear from the body or switches places. Most obvious in the final scene where Millie's character gets a very serious burn on her right side of the upper chest, a few scenes later that has become a scar on her left side. And there are several of these mistakes throughout the entire film.Overall a disappointment, waste of subscribers money and waste of talent. Looking at Angela Basset, not Millie as she seems to only be able to play one type of character.2/10 - A typical Netflix production."," Dull typical Netflix movie"
"200","Damsel","saimariejohnson","8/10","8 March 2024","I love a good fantasy story but I had no idea there would be such a compelling monster sacrifice element to this and found it thoroughly entertaining. I was pleased with Millie as the main character of Elodie. Her tenacity and resilience when faced with insurmountable and endless troubles was on point for a female led ensemble and it's comical that it lends to tongue in cheek on the damsel aspect because while she is in distress for the near duration of the movie save the first 20 minutes, she is not offered any sort of hero or rescuer and that makes it all the more entertaining. I'd recommend it to LoTR, DND, Dragonheart and Harry Potter fans."," Quite good"
