"1","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","Mael777","10/10","27 March 2024","In ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"" the epic showdown between these two legendary titans feels like a nostalgic throwback to the classic Showa Era of Godzilla films, where the focus was on thrilling monster battles. The film doesn't disappoint in this aspect, as the fight sequences are incredibly well-executed and visually stunning, capturing the raw power and scale of these colossal creatures.What sets this film apart is its ability to balance the spectacle of the monster battles with a decent plot that keeps the audience invested. While it may not break new ground in terms of storytelling, the plot serves its purpose by providing enough context and stakes to drive the action forward. It effectively sets the stage for the epic clash between the monsters, making their confrontation feel earned and impactful.One of the standout aspects of the film is its breathtaking visual effects. The CGI is top-notch, seamlessly blending the massive creatures into their environments and delivering jaw-dropping action sequences that truly immerse the audience in the epic battle between the Titans. From the destruction of cityscapes to the intricate details of the monsters themselves, the VFX work is nothing short of astonishing.After watching ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"" I'm left wanting more. The film delivers on its promise of entertainment, offering a thrilling cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impression. I'm already looking forward to revisiting the movie and eagerly anticipating future installments that continue to deliver the same level of excitement and spectacle. Overall, ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is a must-watch for fans of monster movies and anyone looking for an exhilarating ride at the movies."," Great representation of Showa Era!"
"2","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","Gabe-JB","10/10","27 March 2024","Wow, just wow. Now the thing is, the reason I am saying wow, is for a few big reasons that can probably relate to a lot of regular humans like me because I am most definitely human and not Godzilla trying to promote his own film. The reasons being; CGI, Big monster go rahh, and epic battle scenes. Anything else is boring and I frankly could care less about in this film because it affects nothing and all I care about are the things that THE FILM IS ACTUALLY ABOUT (humans).First, I wanna start off by saying that comparing this film's CGI to Godzilla Minus One (greatest Godzilla film that actually made me care about humans), budget wise, is like an insult. GMO had a budget near abouuuut 20 million or so, while GXK had 10x the budget. GMO managed to achieve winning an Oscar with 100x less visual art employees and having the best and probably the most realistic large scale CGI I've seen ever. BUT, the CGI even with such a smaller film beating it, is still excellent as always and doesn't look like some PS5 game that was reprogrammed to run on a Nintendo Switch, unlike other films. It has definitely been one of the consecutive aspects of the MonsterVerse.Monsters; I'm a sucker for Godzilla, not so much Kong, but this version of him definitely catches my eye. Godzilla and Shimo were what really brought this film together, and the funny thing is, before I saw Godzilla with pink atomic breath, it was my most disliked color, but on him, it's my preferred look for him. I also already loved cold related things so a big beast like Shimo definitely made me see this film.Battle Scenes. Now I know, I know, not all Godzilla films can entirely be epic fight scenes, I'M JUST SAYING, I wish they were longer. They are definitely what everyone, including me, came to see, and I am beyond glad with the outcome of the film, that I totally didn't see coming (that's sarcasm), and I actually would love to see more of the franchise, whatever it may be. Also to anyone who disliked the movement speed of Godzilla, watch literally any dated Godzilla film.In summary, I love Godzilla, Dune Part Two and GMO still beat it by an inconceivable number, but if you like big monsters or just Godzilla in General, watch this, maybe watch it again, or just watch the fight scene clips."," Pepto Bismal X Primal Thanos VS.

"3","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","theoneandonlychrismorgan","10/10","29 March 2024","Comparing this film to ""Minus One"" seems odd because they're completely different. This movie is filled with action and takes clear inspiration from the Showa era Godzilla films. On the other hand, ""Minus One"" is more serious in tone, while this one is, to put it mildly, a bit goofy. If you expect the same level of seriousness from both films, you'll likely be let down by this one. However, if you go into it expecting a silly, fun movie, that's exactly what you'll get. There's non-stop monster action throughout the film, with barely a 10-minute break from seeing monsters on the big screen. Ultimately, understanding and embracing the unique qualities of each film is key to enjoying them to the fullest."," Why Compare This to Minus One? They're Different Films."

The movie kept me entertained all the time through the whole movie, and the visuals and design are amazing in this movie, and something I'm going to say there are a lot lore in the Hollow Earth that has to be explored

"5","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","afguser-65878","10/10","30 March 2024","It's disheartening that perpetual dissatisfaction and biased reviews are prevalent in the industry. It's great that you found ""Kong"" to be the best addition, appreciating Kong's leadership and the entertainment value. Each film has its own storyline and merits, making direct comparisons less meaningful. This installment seems to stand out, offering a fresh perspective and an enjoyable experience.Some folks are never happy, and some critics might get paid to write bad stuff. But it's awesome you think ""Kong"" rocks! Kong's a cool leader, and the movie's super fun. Don't compare it to ""Godzilla Minus One"" because they're different stories. Each film is unique, and ""Kong"" stands out for its fresh take and fun vibe."," Don't listen to haters, go watch it!!"
"6","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","ctharvey-86932","10/10","29 March 2024","What do peeps want from these movies...? Monsters fighting? Titans fighting each other? This is a solid movie! Good entertainment! Fast paced and pretty well told. You don't have to see the other (Godzilla, Skull Island, Godzilla v Kong) movies to understand this one. Humans and Titan's together fighting a new enemy. Scar King and Shimo. Plus a special classic Titan makes a comeback. Wew! Nonstop action and fun. My 12 year old son was rooting for G-man! My 16 son was only there for Kong. My wife loved Shimo. I, cheered for them all. This movie is a classic as much as Godzilla v Kong. My family had a great experience seeing this movie. Cheers."," Godzilla x Kong: the new empire."

The story is so so but the action and the visuals are incredible! Not to mention the sound design is top notch too. These are the movies that are made to be seen on the big screen with friends. If having fun at the movies isn't for you then what's the point? The villains and other monsters are a nice addition and even a surprise appearance from someone with definitely make Godzilla fans smile. Hopefully this has a sequel because who doesn't want to keep watching these Titans fight it out WWE style. Go see it on the biggest loudest screen you can!"," Heavyweight beatdown"

"9","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","unknowman-19320","10/10","28 March 2024","Godzilla and Kong stand as two colossal icons in the realm of cinema, and their monumental 2021 film was hailed as a savior of theaters globally, injecting much-needed energy with its epic monster battles and departure from the trend of weighty, serious narratives. Fresh from experiencing its latest installment on IMAX, I'm eager to share my comprehensive thoughts on the film.In essence, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire left me spellbound. It delivered a plethora of captivating action sequences, each imbued with excellent camera work and jaw-dropping CGI/visual effects that seamlessly brought the titans to life. However, it was Kong who truly stole the spotlight as the film's central protagonist. His journey was nothing short of amazing, drawing viewers into his world with expressive emotion and mannerisms that transcended dialogue, making the visual storytelling an absolute delight. From heartwarming interactions with fellow titans like Suko to intense confrontations with formidable foes like Skar King, Kong's character arc was a rollercoaster of emotions, culminating in a satisfying resolution that showcased his growth and resilience.The film's action sequences were not merely excellent; they were downright exhilarating. Each fight scene was meticulously choreographed, utilizing established franchise elements with creative flair. From gravity-defying showdowns to pulse-pounding battles in the heart of bustling cities, every moment was etched into the audience's memory, building towards an electrifying climax that left viewers on the edge of their seats. What truly set this film apart was its homage to the Showa Era, seamlessly blending the franchise's trademark goofiness with modern sensibilities, eliciting cheers and applause from the audience at every turn.One of the film's most commendable aspects was its masterful pacing and intricate plotting. With three intertwining storylines - Kong's Journey, the Human Plot, and the Godzilla Subplot - the film kept viewers engaged from start to finish. Kong's narrative arc was undeniably the standout, but the human plot, while not groundbreaking, showed marked improvement over previous Monsterverse projects. Characters like Jia and Trapper added depth and dimension to the story, while the Godzilla subplot provided a constant undercurrent of tension and anticipation, building towards a climactic showdown that was as epic as it was satisfying.Furthermore, the film boasted a memorable villain whose presence loomed large over every scene. Cruel, menacing, and eerily captivating, the antagonist served as the perfect foil to our heroic protagonists, driving the narrative forward with each nefarious scheme and dastardly deed. The film's worldbuilding was equally impressive, offering tantalizing glimpses into a rich and expansive universe teeming with lore and intrigue.Despite some criticisms online, particularly regarding Godzilla's screen time, I found such complaints to be unfounded. While Kong may have dominated the narrative, Godzilla's presence was felt in every frame, his looming shadow serving as a constant reminder of the impending clash between titans. Moreover, to dismiss the film as mere ""dumb fun"" would be a disservice to its rich storytelling and nuanced character development. From Kong's emotional journey to the human characters' personal struggles and triumphs, the film offered a depth and complexity that transcended its action-packed exterior.In conclusion, Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire is more than just a blockbuster spectacle; it's a triumph of storytelling and visual artistry that pays homage to its iconic predecessors while blazing a trail of its own. With its unforgettable characters, breathtaking action sequences, and heart-pounding suspense, this film is a testament to the enduring power of cinema and a worthy addition to the pantheon of monster classics."," Fun, Exhilarating and underrated Storytelling!"
"10","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","clgarcia","10/10","30 March 2024","Looooove the new monsters, special monster appearance (no spoilers here), baby Kong. Great throwback feel with the soundtrack and spectacular visuals. Wild battles. Audience applause, cheering. What else do you wanna see on the big screen?? Better visuals than GvK. Would love just a little more Godzilla but when he's there it's awesome, and whatever it's a blast.The monsters are great as more developed characters, but without losing any of their monstrousness. The critics seem to miss this fact and are focused on the human characters, no acknowledgment of depth of monster characters. Umm, this is a Godzilla movie. Name one from the old school where you remember more than one of the human characters."," Monsters Shine as Main Characters"
"11","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","jahayaazizi","10/10","27 March 2024","Godzilla x Kong is an pure storytelling movie. Director Adam Wingard understands the assignment for this movie. The action, the colors, the score, it's everything I wanted from a Monsterverse film. The cast is amazing. Dan Stevens,Brian Tyree Henry and Kaylee Hottle are the best characters. The cinematography is great. Epic Monsters battle is great. Kong and Suko are the heart of this movie. The scale is epic. This is nonverbal story of the Monsters. The Monsters treated as characters with respect and honor. This is a love letter to the Showa Godzilla movies. Godzilla has some cool moments in this movie. People needs to watch this movie on IMAX for the art of cinemas. I hope the future of the Monsterverse to be continue.

"12","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","southakur-73964","10/10","27 March 2024","Everyone is just comparing Godzilla X Kong The New Empire with Godzilla Minus One which is such a bad move. These two films have completely different tones and should not be compared. Legendary can make Godzilla movies with Godzilla -1's tone but we must also welcome something different. The action sequences are out of this world and CGI too. Human characters are not the best in Legendary's monsterverse, so we should get over that by now. Be sure to watch it on the big screen. The vibrance is also an another feature of this film that makes me fall in love with it. Maybe it won't be received well by the critics but the audience makes the movie successful and the the audience will LOVE it. A thumbs up from me. üëç"," Sublime"
"13","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","dusanbajec-16807","10/10","27 March 2024","I awaited for this movie for such a long time and oh boy, i was more than astonished!!! This movie is an emotional roller coaster, blending extremely exciting action with touching bonds and epic team ups.Suko, Kong's loyal companion who is like a son to him, steals a spotlight for me, he is so cute and shows his loyalty and affection towards Kong. Godzilla's and Kong's eventual team up is what we all wanted for so many years!!! For these two iconic titans to fight together against Skar King and one other formidable foe.The introduction of the main antagonist of the movie, Skar King is very interesting, I really like the concept of this antagonist as he will bring some emotions to the character as well which is very interesting for a titan to have such human like behavior, and also adds a whole new layer of excitement to the movie with later putting one of the best monster battles ever brought from a movie.But whats truly sets this movie apart is its heart. Amidst the chaos and destruction of the epic monster battles, there are moments of pure emotion between the titans and the humans, and what brings ""The New Empire"" is the new bonds that were made between the characters for me.This is by far the best addition to the Monsterverse yet, it has all that we asked for and its truly a masterpiece, thank you Legendary, This will probably be one of my favorite movies ever made!!! And you MUST watch this on IMAX for the best experience! :D."," This movie has a HEART!!!!! LONG LIVE THE MONSTERVERSE"
"14","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","tmxjvrgqx","10/10","29 March 2024","I watched this move with 5 other people and we all absolutely loved it. The monster fights were absolute insanity and gave me goosebumps every time. The movie gave me a somewhat 80's vibe because of the coloration and soundtrack. And the acting was quite good, the chemistry between Brian-tyree-Henry and Dan Steven was phenomenal and the duo made me laugh every time and there were so many moments in that movie that amazed me. And instead of completely focusing around the humans it mostly focused around the titans and the story of scar king and the great ape army. This movie was a solid 10 out of 10 and I highly recommend you watch this. This is easily one of the best monster-verse movies they have made so far. And just a quick note don't listen to the people who gave the movie a low score. Their are few of them but they just don't enjoy life for what it is and they are generally hard to please."," This movie was absolute insanity!!! And I loved it!!!!"

I cannot express how grateful I was to the world we live in for providing me with the unique opportunity to witness this heavenly movie, which looked like it was provided by God almighty himself.

My expectations were kind of meh, me personally, Godzilla Vs Kong (GVK) was OKAY, nothing special, maybe about a 6/10So who won this time in Godzilla X Kong & what is this New Empire?... well legendary studios of course!After a victorious achievement for Toho... we all know what we've come for here at legendary studios, & the results are definitely not a minus one...because this time we up the ante, and the people have spoken, we want this, legendary in this film is simply unlocking the massive cheese vault oozing into my optic stems, Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire is a hyper adrenaline rush energizer, it felt like my brain waves digested a high voltage energy drink kicking every inch of my brain cells.Dan Stevens is a solid comic relief along with Brian Tyree Henry. The jokes land a bit better this time around. The aura & creative decisions in this film have almost an 80's vintage vibrant feel, the music & color palette compliment each other perfectly along with cinematography.My issues? Well... why does the movie have Monarch being okay with bringing anybody down to hollow earth? Reliance on slight jumpy exposition, small things that could have been explored a little more to leave more an impact. It's not perfect for those, however I will argue this film was a lot closer to striking close to being perfect than you would think a film of this caliber could do.This is what happens when Cinematography, awareness, consistency & finding the footing on following Kaijus, gets the best of a cinematic experience, it's just as much a kaiju story as it is a human story & It's a Love Letter to the showa era & fans should be proud.I've never been more invested in the actual story of the kaijus until this movie, expositions & humans don't ruin it either this time. It's not anything special, but what is special are what we are here for, & that's the Kaijus.New Empire, by far, has the longest showtime for Kaiju action that I've ever seen in a monster flick. Beautifully shot cinematic camera scenes, there is one specific upside down shot unfolding to the right side up, just amazing cameraworkThe gradual building blocks embedded in the story left exciting awe in entertainment & care of handling Kaiju moments. The humans are just enhancers for the monsters. Compared to GVK, they have a better direction here without getting lost.It's a ride, took the issues of GVK & corrected it more, there's plenty of action if not more than you'd think... there's plenty of surprises, emotional character moments with humans/monsters, & although a not so perfect expositions still a solid fun plot/story following the elements at play... Godzilla X Kong was a lot better than I thought it was going to be & that's worth something."," The best monstervers film"

I'll never be able to watch a movie again because i know nothing can compare to this movie. It is so good I can't even comprehend it and the directors were definitely putting some work behind the monster emotions. I had went to go see this having low expectations but this movie banged. The humans in the background were hyping up the big fight and the monsters have this cool vibe. Very lit where the monsters come together and have this big fight, something I live for. One thing I didn't like about godzilla and kong is that they tried to force this convoluted plot to make them team up and it kind of gets ridiculous and didn't feel natural. Another thing I do not like is that they tried to make the humans important characters like I do not want to watch godzilla and kong for the humans, I want to watch it for the big cgi monsters fighting."," the movie"

Human scenes and monster scenes are handled perfectly. In fact monsters are given more importance than humans as there is no scenes which seems to be boring and there is no scenes to be taken to extend the length of movie.

Its a Kong centered movie, with Godzilla making cameos here and there but it's fine, I like both of them equally. I was little bit iffy on Godzillas new evolution, but it's grown on me, he looks WAY more powerful than he was in the previous films. And of course the best part for me was the final battle: Godzilla and Kong charging at Skar King and Shimo, and fighting in zero gravity. And of course Mothras return was especially amazing, also its cool that Kong has adopted Suko as his son and formed a bond.

"26","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","Slarkshark","7/10","30 March 2024","Lots of Titans fighting. That's why we go to something like this, right?G X K is about the same for entertainment wise as G vs K, though I'd give the newest entry a slight edge for a couple of reasons. For one, there's a bit less silliness. There's comic relief of course, but it's not out of place or goofy. The 80's throwbacks with the tunes, synths, and vibes were great. And lastly, the Titans were back to being the bad guys instead of humans. I always find it a bore when you watch a movie about monsters fighting, but have to bare through a story of human villains and their idiotic ideologies.A side note, it's hilarious that these Titans seem to really enjoy having their royal rumbles in the biggest cities on the planet, or while destroying some of the world's most revered structures. Like really guys, you couldn't have thrown down in the middle of the Sahara? More destruction equals more entertainment I suppose. Also, Godzilla just casually murders hundreds if not thousands just walking around from point A to point B. I digress. Go pink Zilla!"," Project Powerhouse"
"27","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","FireJach","6/10","27 March 2024","Monster = hurrah
Humans = garbageAnother Monster-Verse installment to the collection gave me another reason to visit my cinema. Luckily, I wasn't disappointed, I got everything what I expected which might be summoned by the two equations above.About humans:
If you want to watch the movie at home, don't waste time on humans subplot. It's completely pointless. The dialogues aren't funny or smart. They serve poor exposition which is painfully exhausting to watch. You see the monsters fighting and these ""characters"" are explaining in between: oh, he is protecting! - Come on, who wrote this? In my opinion if Legendary Studios wants to include humans, they should at least try making them just little interesting or just remove them completely. None of them is doing anything necessary, furthermore whatever they're doing doesn't make any sense. Why the hell are they in the Hollow Earth without protection? One guy is just in a Hawaiian shirt. The amount of dangerous monsters is not alarming, I guess... Paper Boy is filming everything but the British guy in a Hawaiian shirt says something like: It's better to keep it in a secret, this ancient civilization shouldn't be exposed to our world. The girl from Godzilla Vs. Kong (she is from that world and has weird X-Men power (?)) is among modern people, so the world already knows the underground world. What does he want to hide? There is more of this stupidity.About the monsters:
Kong is the lead. His journey is simple, he feels lonely, he wants to have a family of his kind. From the trailers you know, there is more giant apes, so I am happy to see them because I am Team Kong :) I'd want to appreciate the ""dialogues"" between Kong and this little ginger fella. They don't use words as we do but believe me, these two are more interesting than the humans. You will enjoy it.Godzilla and the rest are just monsters. Sadly Godzilla isn't intimidating in this movie, his only goal is to gain the pink level of nuclear power and then use it to fight the bad monkey. However, the fight scenes are awesome - this is why we are watching this type of movies, so if you're a fan of giant monsters, I recommend Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire... and don't expect to see raise of ""the new empire"" in this movie. It's a kinda awkward title generated by ChatGPT."," Please, just remove humans from this"
"28","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","Jeremy_Urquhart","7/10","28 March 2024","Absolute nonsense, and anyone who didn't like Godzilla vs. Kong will probably hate this. I enjoyed myself the same way I'd enjoy eating two bags of potato chips in one sitting. I'm feeling a bit empty and confused at why I did such a thing now it's over, but it was tasty junk at the time.I feel like Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire has the least dialogue out of any giant monster movie of the last decade or so, maybe longer. It keeps the human characters at a minimum, which is a double-edged sword. They're not as frequently annoying, but when you have a small cast of humans, the sense of danger dissipates, because no one is the kind of character that could die at any point before the very end (and even then). But all the scenes with the giant apes, with no dialogue? Good stuff. The humans are there to just explain stuff that doesn't really need to be explained. I almost wish this had been a silent movie.There's some good schlock here. I laughed a lot. There's a lot of action, maybe too much. It ends very suddenly, the two titular monsters take a while to meet up, and though I liked the main villain, he takes too long to be introduced. The narrative here is a mess, and it only gets by through having so many different creatures, fights, and ridiculous sci-fi concepts.Still, it's not the kind of kaiju movie where people will complain that ""there weren't enough monsters."" I feel like Godzilla x Kong provides plenty of dumb entertainment, ridiculous spectacle, and action to the point where watching it was never dull for a minute. I had fun, but looking back on it now, it does feel like the cinematic equivalent of (a lot of) empty calories."," Godsilly"
"29","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","BA_Harrison","3/10","30 March 2024","When asked what his plan is, a character in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire says 'throw everything at the wall and see what sticks'. Director Adam Wingard has adopted this approach when making this film, but on this occasion very little that is being randomly tossed about actually sticks. The smackdowns between the film's creatures are loud, frantic and reasonably fun, but the plot is a sloppy turd of Titan proportions -- a stinky, contrived, overblown mess brought to life in a maelstrom of not very convincing CGI.The script is absolutely terrible, and the majority of the film had me either scratching my head in confusion or laughing at its preposterousness. Kong being equipped with a metal fist is an undeniably cool idea, but the fact that the protagonists just happen to have such a device on hand in Hollow Earth is just crazy (especially one with built in anti-frostbite serum!). A vet who knows how to extract a Kong tooth also knows how to fly a Hollow Earth hover ship -- clearly a man of many talents. God only knows what the Iwi tribe were up to with their glowing pyramids. What was the deal with that glowing spike that nasty ape used to control the ice lizard? And why did everyone suddenly start floating around in Hollow Earth? (there might have been explanations for some of these points, but they became lost in all of the chaos).After Godzilla Minus One, I suggest leaving all future films featuring the big lizard to the Japanese.3.5/10, rounded down to 3 for Kaylee Hottle's perpetually anxious look -- doesn't the girl have any other expressions?"," The plot stinks worse than Kong poo."

They gave it a solid 10/10, so for the audience that doesn't want anything serious - this is hella perfect.The story wasn't anything new that we haven't seen before but it serves the movie good. My biggest problem with it, was the human characters. Just like ""Godzilla vs Kong"", the characters are flat and i would rather watch monsters fight than them.The direction by Adam Wingard is pretty good. The action in particulat is really well done and you can really see what's going on.The actors were OK for the most part but for the script they are given, they are fine.Giant praise to the VFX. Everything looked amazaing and you can see that the money went in the place, not like ""Captain Marvel 2"" for example, which had a 300 million dollar budget and for the money, it looked awful.The music is good too. I wouldn't buy a soundtrack but it served the story.Overall if you just want to have fun for 2 hours, this movie is perfect."," Big Budget B-Movie"

My expectations were kind of meh, me personally, Godzilla Vs Kong (GVK) was OKAY, nothing special, maybe about a 6/10So who won this time in Godzilla X Kong & what is this New Empire?... well legendary studios of course!After a victorious achievement for Toho... we all know what we've come for here at legendary studios, & the results are definitely not a minus one...because this time we up the ante, and the people have spoken, we want this, legendary in this film is simply unlocking the massive cheese vault oozing into my optic stems, Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire is a hyper adrenaline rush energizer, it felt like my brain waves digested a high voltage energy drink kicking every inch of my brain cells.Dan Stevens is a solid comic relief along with Brian Tyree Henry. The jokes land a bit better this time around. The aura & creative decisions in this film have almost an 80's vintage vibrant feel, the music & color palette compliment each other perfectly along with cinematography.My issues? Well... why does the movie have Monarch being okay with bringing anybody down to hollow earth? Reliance on slight jumpy exposition, small things that could have been explored a little more to leave more an impact. It's not perfect for those, however I will argue this film was a lot closer to striking close to being perfect than you would think a film of this caliber could do.This is what happens when Cinematography, awareness, consistency & finding the footing on following Kaijus, gets the best of a cinematic experience, it's just as much a kaiju story as it is a human story & It's a Love Letter to the showa era & fans should be proud.I've never been more invested in the actual story of the kaijus until this movie, expositions & humans don't ruin it either this time. It's not anything special, but what is special are what we are here for, & that's the Kaijus.New Empire, by far, has the longest showtime for Kaiju action that I've ever seen in a monster flick. Beautifully shot cinematic camera scenes, there is one specific upside down shot unfolding to the right side up, just amazing cameraworkThe gradual building blocks embedded in the story left exciting awe in entertainment & care of handling Kaiju moments. The humans are just enhancers for the monsters. Compared to GVK, they have a better direction here without getting lost.It's a ride, took the issues of GVK & corrected it more, there's plenty of action if not more than you'd think... there's plenty of surprises, emotional character moments with humans/monsters, & although a not so perfect expositions still a solid fun plot/story following the elements at play... Godzilla X Kong was a lot better than I thought it was going to be & that's worth something.7.5 / 10."," Who won? Legendary studios, & far from a minus one."
"32","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","paul_haakonsen","9/10","29 March 2024","I sat down to watch the 2024 movie ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"", and I was actually just expecting to be another run-of-the-mill recent times monster bash movie, as the newer movies with Godzilla and King Kong has proved to be. Now, don't get me wrong, because I have thoroughly and genuinely enjoyed the recent movies, by all means, but they were not really outstanding.And then director Adam Wingard brought ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" to the table. Holy Monster Bash, Batman, what a phenomenal surprise of a movie this turned out to be. I have to say that I was blown away by this movie, and I had not seen a movie of this magnitude making its appearance. I was fully and wholly entertained throughout the course of the 115 minutes that the movie ran for.The storyline in ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"", as written by Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett, Jeremy Slater and Adam Wingard, is pretty straightforward. But what works here, in comparison to the many previous newer Godzilla and/or King Kong movies, was that this movie was all amount Titans fighting one another, and the human storylines were mere backdrops. That worked so well for me, because the insane amount of action in terms of Titans fighting throughout the course of the movie, was amazing. And it made the movie work on such a great level for me. Seeing Godzilla and King Kong fighting, or either of them fighting other Titans, now that is why I sit down to watch movies such as this. And, oh boy, did director Adam Wingard deliver her.The acting performances in the movie are good, and I have to say that I wasn't really overly familiar with any of the actors or actresses on the cast list. Sure, I've seen some of them before, but am not all that familiar with their previous work. Kaylee Hottle (playing Kia) and Fala Chen (playing the Iwi Queen) definitely put on memorable performances with their characters.Something that is important for a monster bash movie such as ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" are special effects. And wow. I was beyond amazed here. The CGI in the movie is phenomenal, and it looks so great and realistic. And the sheer amount of mayhed and destruction throughout the course of the movie almost had me cheering in the cinema. This is definitely the most intense Kaiju movie (or Titans as they are called in this movie) I have ever seen. And that alone makes it more than well-worth sitting down to watch ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"".""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is how Kaiju (or Titan) movies are supposed to be. And this particular movie from director Adam Wingard was simply amazing. This is a movie that I strongly and warmly recommend you to go watch. Do it in the cinema, because the sounds of the Titans roaring and battling is so well-worth getting shook through from the cinema speakers. I loved that about the movie as well.I am a fan of this movie, no doubt about it. And when I walked out of the cinema, it was with a big 'wow, are you kidding me' feel. Because Adam Wingard's 2024 movie ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" was over-the-top and exactly how such a movie should be.My rating of ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" lands on a rock-solid nine out of ten stars."," Prepare to be blown away..."
"33","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","vinayaksrivastava-20682","6/10","29 March 2024","Releasing merely weeks after the critically and commercially acclaimed ""Godzilla Minus One"" won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects is a boon as well as bane for ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" - while more people are familiar with the behemoth radioactive lizard, there is an undeniable urge to draw comparisons between the two movies. Adam Wingard's second Monsterverse film following 2021's ""Godzilla vs Kong"" delivers satisfying Titan action, but overall, the film feels like a step back, largely owing to dull and tedious human drama.Personally, I found ""Godzilla vs Kong"" to be the best Monsterverse film. It embraced the absurdity and silliness of its premise and made the most of it to deliver one hell of a show, placing the Titans front and centre, while jettisoning any unnecessary human drama. ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" starts off much slower, with the actual plot taking nearly 20 minutes to kick in. Combined with an uptick in uninteresting human drama, this slows down the movie with certain portions feeling boring.Much like its predecessor, ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" struggles trying to the connect the stories of the two leading titans. Kong is the heart and soul of the movie, with Godzilla largely feeling like an accomplice or sidekick. The first half of the movie is almost entirely about Kong's exploration of Hollow Earth, the subterranean ecosystem where the Titans live. While learning about the mystical world was engaging and intriguing, it lead to a delayed introduction of the villain, leading to the third act feeling slightly rushed and less rewarding compared to the enthralling finale of ""Godzilla vs Kong"".The action sequences themselves are a whole lot of fun, with a face off in hollow earth with gravity slightly messed-up being one of my favourites of the entire franchise. The finale in Rio delivers plentiful excitement and fun too.""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is best suited for fans of the Showa era. For Kong fans(like myself), there is a lot to like about the movie, owing to the humanisation of the great ape. The action scenes are fun, colourful and campy, similar to it's predecessor, but an increased focus on human characters and a slower pace make this a slightly underwhelming entry to the Monsterverse."," A brainless, but (mostly) entertaining monster mash."
"34","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","GregTheStopSign95","8/10","29 March 2024","I don't know what I expected going in to see this at the cinema, but it wasn't this. I guess I expected more focus on the humans (again) and less on the Titans (again)...but this? This was not that. Yeah they had humans, but they were mostly more of a footnote in the story, which could have been almost completely told without the humans, but they did add a little flavour to the mix. Especially Dan Stevens. But then I AM kinda biased towards him as I've loved his work in everything I've seen him in so far.All that aside, Kong was great - and MASSIVE - and Godzilla was pretty damn impressive, too - and just as massive as Kong - but more than that, we got a look at a few other Titans as well, and they were ALL pretty impressively brought to life here. My ONLY gripe about Kong himself is that, in the early going the filmmakers tried to humanise him just that little but too much, and it kinda fell flat to me. Once things actually got moving and shaking, though, it all got a lot better."," A worthy entry in the MonsterVerse"

Here, hollow earth is vastly explored with great visuals and Kong delivers an exceptional performance! The fight sequences are to the point and give great depth to the brutality of the situation on earth. As a kaiju fan I could not ask for anything more than to see monsters go at it and save the planet. Such as any other monster movie people go see. Godzilla is true to form and is his usual reign of terror to other kaiju. The human provide the skeleton of the story but the monsters carry it! I had so much fun with this movie!

Fortunately, this time it was so entertaining that you can ignore the dumb parts.And of course, it's not an ambitious movie, there's a lot of cliche, oversimplification etc., but I still expected worse. Most of the time humans are not acting like idiots, their crazy ideas are pretty convincing within this world and the whole cast does a great job keeping us entertained. Relations between our human characters work pretty well.There's a lot of worldbuilding here, successfull one in my opinion. Ancient civilization, prophecies, stories written on walls, some scores to even. The Hollow Earth looks great, you can see how this whole ecosystems works with its own rules.And finally, Titans. CGI is really good, fight scenes don't disappoint and, the most important thing, monsters act like they should act. There's startegy, there's a lot of preparing, but also there's hierarchy, decisions made out of fear and fights for territory. Writers managed to make the Titans seem humane while also staying within their animal nature. The outcome of that is convincing, at least for me.Some people might have a problem with the fact that most of this movie is basically assembilng the team for the final battle, but I think this time Monsterverse used a cliche in pretty much the best way possible.In the end, Godzilla x Kong is a satisfying and engaging blockbuster as well as great addition to the franchise.

Seeing this at the cinema was a great ride. Not perfect movie in any form or way, but having a few beers and watching big huge monsters fight is something special.The negatives are that the CGi is not always perfect, but it does not matter too much. Another thing is that the first team going down under seem inadequate. Not really the people (at least not alone) you should send on this type of mission. The third thing is that things get a bit too much. The characters are over the top, the dentist dude is way over the top, the action is over the top. We do not only have big freaking monsters fighting, we have an ice monster aiming to bring in a new ice age, we have some alien things, weird anti gravity technology, and humans just happen to have a big freaking mechanical arm ready for Kong - which of course is a perfect fit. It all culminate in a enormous fight on Earth's surface which is also over the top.Extremely entertaining, but otherwise kinda meh. Still the best of the franchise so far and it is hard to really complain.This is not an intellectual movie, and will never win any awards, but whooooooo cares.

"39","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","FeastMode","3/10","29 March 2024","I keep coming back to these movies. Over and over. I love monster movies and can enjoy dumb-fun action. I'm the exact target audience. How do they continue to fail? Aside from Godzilla (2014), they range from mediocre to terrible. And GxK is no different.I know most reviews will compare this to Godzilla Minus One. But I have to. Every single Godzilla shot from Minus One is better than every single shot of him in GxK. Every single action scene in Minus One is better than every single one in GxK. Better story, characters, dialogue, emotional investment. Everything. Minus One is better in every way.The worst thing I can say about GxK is... I was so bored. And I didn't care about anything that was happening. Zero investment. This is partly because it doesn't really have a story. Stuff just happens. Halfway through, I still didn't know what the story was about, what conflict we might be heading to, any kind of build up of a threat.They continue with another useless human plot, completely formulaic and bland. One of the only positives is a highly talented cast. They're just not given anything to work with. Rebecca Hall is the only one who gets to show her talent.Even worse is the 50+ comedic attempts. I laughed twice. The nearly sold out crowd laughed a few times. The rest made me cringe. They're like dad jokes. The entirety of the human story is basically a kids movie.What about the titans? They rarely show the scale of these monsters. Most of the time it's from the perspective of the monsters, not the humans. So they always look like they're 6 feet tall, with everything around just smaller.Even the movements are so fast like humans are fighting. When they fall, they fall in a second. No ground-shaking impact. It feels so fake and nowhere close to epic. I'm not anti-CGI, but the big action scenes are hectic gibberish.I give up. It shouldn't be this difficult. I don't even need it to be a ""good"" movie. Just entertaining with good action. Instead I get forgettable and dumb.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 3/28/2024)"," Hectic gibberish"

"45","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","totalovrdose","5/10","1 April 2024","The recent American Godzilla films have not exactly been narrative driven think-pieces, but rather monster-on-monster brawlers. If you want monster action, The New Empire has it in spades, and is easily the most beautiful of the four recent films. The Titans, every one of them, looks eye-wateringly outstanding, an absolute stand-out being Mothra, who remains as gorgeous as she was in King of the Monsters.Godzilla looks great, and his new colour palette is especially amazing, and though he gets top billing in the title, he is side-lined in his own film, in favour of Kong. Don't get me wrong, Kong is a good draw in this film, in his pursuit to hopefully find other giant apes in the Hollow Earth, a realm which is as epic as the monsters that reside there; it just would have been good to see more of our favourite lizard too.Though the effects will absolutely be the number one reason to see this film, the story, script and human characters are certainly not. The script is the most contrived, convenient mess this addition to the franchise has ever seen. Example, 'we need special item - lucky, it is right next to us, though we never mentioned it before until now because...reasons.'A massive thing missing from this monster movie is a heart. The first two films had Ken Watanabe's Serizawa, a sole believer in Godzilla and the titans, who fought for co-existence between monsters and humanity. The third entry had Millie Bobby Brown's Madison, who exhibited an undying faith in Godzilla when others did not. This film? Yeah, none of that.Rebecca Hall does her best as Dr. Andrews, and despite the occasional moment where she can flex her acting muscles (let's face it, she deserves better than this), she is normally used as an exposition tool, simply telling us the back-story and describing what will happen next. Think of the film this way - there is a big monster scene, then Dr. Andrews will explain why and what happens next - then there will be another monster scene - rinse and repeat.Bryan Henry and Dan Stevens share the role of comedic relief, though it is Ron Smyck as Harris who arguably had some of the best lines (and deserved more screen time). The film at times often feels like a comedy, more than an action feature, trying to squeeze in as many 'funny' lines as a Marvel film.The music is of course as on point as ever - a bombastic score that makes every set-piece that much more entertaining, but that's all this film has - it is the most beautiful and colourful the monsterverse has ever been - but it is shallower than any puddle you'll find."," A Beautiful Piece of Garbage"

The film doesn't disappoint in this aspect, as the fight sequences are incredibly well-executed and visually stunning, capturing the raw power and scale of these colossal creatures.What sets this film apart is its ability to balance the spectacle of the monster battles with a decent plot that keeps the audience invested. While it may not break new ground in terms of storytelling, the plot serves its purpose by providing enough context and stakes to drive the action forward. It effectively sets the stage for the epic clash between the monsters, making their confrontation feel earned and impactful.One of the standout aspects of the film is its breathtaking visual effects.

"47","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","Gabe-JB","10/10","27 March 2024","Wow, just wow. Now the thing is, the reason I am saying wow, is for a few big reasons that can probably relate to a lot of regular humans like me because I am most definitely human and not Godzilla trying to promote his own film. The reasons being; CGI, Big monster go rahh, and epic battle scenes. Anything else is boring and I frankly could care less about in this film because it affects nothing and all I care about are the things that THE FILM IS ACTUALLY ABOUT (humans).First, I wanna start off by saying that comparing this film's CGI to Godzilla Minus One (greatest Godzilla film that actually made me care about humans), budget wise, is like an insult. GMO had a budget near abouuuut 20 million or so, while GXK had 10x the budget. GMO managed to achieve winning an Oscar with 100x less visual art employees and having the best and probably the most realistic large scale CGI I've seen ever. BUT, the CGI even with such a smaller film beating it, is still excellent as always and doesn't look like some PS5 game that was reprogrammed to run on a Nintendo Switch, unlike other films. It has definitely been one of the consecutive aspects of the MonsterVerse.Monsters; I'm a sucker for Godzilla, not so much Kong, but this version of him definitely catches my eye. Godzilla and Shimo were what really brought this film together, and the funny thing is, before I saw Godzilla with pink atomic breath, it was my most disliked color, but on him, it's my preferred look for him. I also already loved cold related things so a big beast like Shimo definitely made me see this film.Battle Scenes. Now I know, I know, not all Godzilla films can entirely be epic fight scenes, I'M JUST SAYING, I wish they were longer. They are definitely what everyone, including me, came to see, and I am beyond glad with the outcome of the film, that I totally didn't see coming (that's sarcasm), and I actually would love to see more of the franchise, whatever it may be. Also to anyone who disliked the movement speed of Godzilla, watch literally any dated Godzilla film.In summary, I love Godzilla, Dune Part Two and GMO still beat it by an inconceivable number, but if you like big monsters or just Godzilla in General, watch this, maybe watch it again, or just watch the fight scene clips."," Pepto Bismal X Primal Thanos VS.

Don't get me wrong, Godzilla -1 was great. But that's a different monster, literally. Samuel Jackson, Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Millie Bobbie Brown, Rebecca Hall, all great actors, love their other work. I don't care about their collective back story / family drama when it gets in the way of giant CGI Kong / Godzilla / Monster fights. This is the Warner Bothers version finally done right. From literally the opening shot it's a giant Kong monster fight followed by another giant CGI monster fight followed by another, and then another, every 5 maybe 10 minutes tops.

"49","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire","sinscopefilms","5/10","30 March 2024","Cinematography: the cinematography in the film was a standout; it utilized different types of lenses (e.g., wide angle) and different camera focuses with some blur in the background. It was innovative on one hand, but not over the top. The close-ups and medium shots were great.Editing and Pacing: Editing was commendable. Sometimes the pacing keeps me engaged, but then the narrative structure does not always keep up, with plot twists and character arcs that feel aimless or underdeveloped at times.Sound and Music: Sound and music play pivotal roles in setting the tone, with the electronic score punctuating the epic battles and quiet moments alike. However, the choice to abruptly cut music in some of the scenes detracts from the cohesion of the film's soundscape, leaving a disjointed impression that the rest of the soundtrack struggles to mend. In the second act, the soundtrack was very generic. It sounded similarly to what you can hear in typical superhero films with a ""heroic"" vibe. The whole second and third acts felt like a generic viewing experience.VFX: Visual effects are where the film shines brightest, crafting a world that is at once familiar and fantastically alien. The VFX was innovative and pushed the boundaries of the genre.CGI: The reliance on CGI is super heavy. On one hand, some CGI moments were great, but on the other hand, as the movie progressed, it became so much that I didn't want to watch it anymore because it looked generic. It feels like I am watching an animation film. Using too much CGI instead of real locations can sometimes break the immersive experience; the use of more authentic natural landscapes could benefit the film.Cast: The cast was incompetent. It often felt misplaced or unable to fully embody the larger-than-life characters they portray, which exacerbates this. In other words, it felt like I was watching actors from a 2012 parody movie.Costume Design: The character's costume design was terrible. They could have created unique costume designs for the characters, such as having the same for everyone while traveling.The movie's emotional and intellectual engagement was inconsistent. Mysticism and technology are both big ideas in the movie, but the story is both big, undeveloped, and hard to follow. I wish this film had more depth, meaningfulness and clarity. Also, Godzilla had less screen time, which is sad.In conclusion, ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is a mixed bag. There is too much going on, and every detail (e.g., large, small or microscopic) is difficult to digest through visual storytelling. Individuals seeking a narrative with depth and coherence, not just smashing things, might feel it falls short in that aspect. Although the film has flaws, it showcases the progress in VFX."," Mixed bag and too much CGI"

There are many great eye popping visuals, epic destructice action scenes and crazy monsters running throughout screen which will keep you entertained for nearly two hours.. Storywise it's nothing new like every other movie Godzilla awakes attacks somewhere which lead him to another monster, they fight and Godzilla wins.. The end, meanwhile some human scientists will do crazy things throughout the movie.. I mean cmon isn't it what all Monsterverse movies are??But some things are meant to be enjoyed without paying too much attention to the story and turn off you brain to enjoy the ride, this franchise is all about this concept.. You'll get some epic action scenes, buildings crumblings to dust, monsters clashing and some drama... I mean what else can you expect from a franchise about monsters. Lol

Bustling with unforced energy from start to finish it's stands alone as a solid fantasy film even whilst standing within that hefty Ghostbusters shadow. The cast is great, with the Spengler family continuing to make these new films their own along with the surprising yet excellent addition of James Acaster as a new ""Q"" styled member of the team. Dan Akroyd beautifully ties in the nostalgia while helping to hand over the baton. With nods to the original(s) handled very well. Expect a few laughs along the way in what is an excellent story.

Her interaction with the one ghost was awkward at times but tricked me on where it was going.Loved the possessor. Slimmer was great to see. I hope they do another to improve.

It's contrived.Afterlife made a half decent attempt of being the franchise back to life, but this simply trashes all the positive steps it made.You get to see some great old characters come back and do nothing.You get to see the new characters perform pointless roles in a completely under fleshed storyline, that I'm struggling to find a comparable movie where talent is so terribly wasted.It's not even worth watching to see how poor it is."," Ghostbustin' makes me feel sad"
"54","Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire","nrtallon","6/10","31 March 2024","When a sequel is made, it is done for one of two reasons: the writers still have creative juices to strain, or the studio still has a cash cow to milk. A lot of movies from anywhere from 5 to 15 years ago until now have felt like the latter. The storyline of the franchise was fine where it was. There were no loose ends, and the characters were no longer in turmoil. Out of the blue another villain comes along for the sequel, and it happens again.Ghostbusters: Afterlife was not one of these. It was a charming movie and I loved all the little details, and I was wrapped up in the plot. I would not have to be dragged behind a horse to be convinced to watch it again.Frozen Empire was different. It still had charm and character, but it felt more reliant on the nostalgia of the series to keep the audience watching. In a vacuum, it's not that great of a movie. The plot isn't all too exciting, there are minor inconsistencies here and there, and it felt too formulaic and forced. The problems seem to come out of the blue, I mean, ghosts aren't normal, but past movies did a better job of explaining the threat. I probably will forget about this movie in five years and maybe won't watch it again for at least a decade. It's not a movie I enjoy so much that I still have fun the second time around. And this probably won't be the last of the franchise either, the last one was made only three years ago, and for a good movie that can be no time at all. They should take their time and put everything together right, which I know won't be what the studio wants because the original actors will be retiring soon and they probably want another movie with them in it.Now, I am certainly biased because of the upsetting trend I have seen where franchises start putting less effort into writing great stories and putting more effort into ""stunning"" visual effects. Now, with technology where it's at, we can visualize anything, it's not that big of a deal anymore. You can't hide behind a cool CGI show anymore. I don't know, it's just not hitting all the bases for me."," Could have been any other generic franchise"

I'm a massive fan of the original Ghostbusters and enjoyed Afterlife as it was in keeping with the original films. This film carries on the franchise, retaining the originals and allowing the new cast to thrive. I'm not sure what people were talking about regarding character development. The story revolves around Phoebe and the character development is there. I also think Paul Rudd fits Ghostbusters perfectly. Dan Ackroyd / Ray was amazing as ever and Winston and Venkman make appearances for good measure. This is the first time I have ever gone to the cinema alone as I wanted to see this film.

Then, the characters pile up, action draws to a close and we're doled out a frankly dumb and patronising parenting sub-plot, within not much of a plot. Whatever happened to escapism in cinema? Paul Rudd is supremely irritating as the kooky everyman, Carrie Coon uncharismatic and an ensemble of work-in-progress teen actors are each vying for attention like they're in a school play. Each dialed-in witticism sinks without trace. Dan Ackroyd is probably the most compelling force in the movie, but you can't rely on one seasoned actor to do the heavy lifting. The 2016 reboot had far more swagger and intelligence than this.Finale was meh and effects-wise, seemed like the budget had been exhausted by the ridiculously extended payroll.Nope.

I find most movies these days overuse cgi and creates an extremely fake realm, where this movie really gets the effects right.

Not sure why Bill Murray is even in this movie - if he made more than a few thousand dollars for his appearance, he was overpaid. Only has about 10 lines, none of which are meaningful.There is no character development, and the new mom & dad (of the new Ghostbusters) have no real personalities of their own, especially the mother.Add to this all the inconsistencies in the plot. The way certain problems are remedied have no real or logical explanations, even in the context of a movie that demands that you suspend disbelief.I thought Ghostbusters 2 was bad, but this one is far worse.

I liked that it had a lot of references to the original movie and brought back som of the original actors too. It seemed like it was a little short and could have been a little more developed in places I thought it was good that it made Ghostbusters relatable to a younger generation.

"69","Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire","socaliguy","2/10","1 April 2024","*Spoiler alert* As someone who absolutely loved Afterlife and all previous Ghostbuster movies with a passion, I was terribly disappointed in this lazily written and poorly executed sequel. It felt like the movie needed an extra 30-45 minutes to truly develop the storyline and characters but never got there. Bill Murray was palpably unenthusiastic and Dan Akroyd was okay at best. The billionaire philanthropist, Winston Zeddemore, created a state-of-the-art ghost jail and research facility, and then apparently proceeded to hire a child and stereotypical science nerd to run the place, while simultaneously forgetting to install a security system, hire a guard, or install a backup power generation system which the entire place relied on to keep ghosts in their cells. The villain, ""Garraka"", was too graphic for younger audience members, while also lacking any real depth as a bad guy. Its always puzzling that these ancient souls existed before the earliest known languages, but somehow manage to speak modern English at the same time. The final battle resulted in most of the characters being frozen, yet miraculously reanimating just in time for the final battle. The containment system which blew up and released every ghost ever caught was also somehow turned into the trap that caught Garraka. No real conclusion as to what happened to all the other ghosts that were released as we are to assume they were just magically trapped at the same time even though they were assumedly spread out all over the tristate area. To wrap this up, even though I could go on, the manner in which Phoebe melted down brass using a handheld torch and then proceeded to pour it over the particle accelerator without any collateral damage to any of the other sensitive components was laughably dumb and completely unbelievable. Honestly, the rare moments I caught myself enjoying this movie were the moments when Kumail would seemingly join me in my disbelief of the nonsense they were trying to sell us. His comedic performance saved this movie from being a total failure, even though his character somehow mastering the ancient magic skill of being a fire master went from not believing in it at all, to him struggling to light a candle, to defeating Garraka within the span of a few hours. I truly hope the franchise doesn't become another Marvel-esque cash-grab, but if this film was any clue, I have low expectations for future sequels but hope they will use the same formula as Afterlife if they do."," Heartbroken."

Good bits Ray and the gang are in it some funny jokes, the bad bits too much teenage drama and hints of ghost busting without really seeing it (dunno if this is budget related) not enough Bill Murray. Pacing at times was ... teenager drama driven and dragged down the pace.

Especially the return of the old ghost busters and the iconic theme song was pretty well done. But it would be hard to do anything wrong with that.For me, everything else was very mediocre. The storyline felt very slow and when it finally began to be exciting, it was cut short and the movie ended.The movie honestly failed to make me feel connected to the newer characters. The cast wasn't too bad but actors like Finn Wolfhard, who are only known for one big role, are often not a great choice for another franchise movie, because they're always kind of ""that one character"" (There are many famous exceptions like Margot Robbie or Christian Bale, who can do great performances while not being known for one role). I think a rather unknown actor would've been a better choice, but maybe they just needed to target a certain fan base.Also, the entire storyline between Melody and Fibi kind of felt like it was only there to have the plot make sense.I think the movie is definitely a fun time, especially if you're a fan of the original, but it's mostly built on nostalgia and not too great."," okay-ish movie built on nostalgia"

The joy of ghostbusters was that it was free wheeeling, that it was anarchic. That, similar to the Blues Brothers, somebody had allowed a bunch of slackers to spend millions on making a movie which to coin Bill Murray from Meatballs ""just didn't matter"".

No character development anymore. There is no strong conflict to build up twist and tension. The villain is pathetic and the last fight is so forgettable.

I would love to live in that universe, but this universe is pretty good. I really love how they are developing these movies. Not just the kid's physical growth but growth in the story. It makes no sense that the Ghostbusters would be stuck in 1984 and they are not. Especially Winsten Zedmore. This movie and the last really seemed to want to make up for the fact that they kind of dismissed his popularity in the first set of movies to making him the pinpoint to why the Ghostbusters are back in these films.It was a huge ensemble cast. It was actually cool that so many people were in the movie even though most of them had no importance in the movie, with ofcourse the exception of Bill Muray who felt like they needed to squeeze a man in the film that did not want to be there but I'm sure the paycheck was huge just to say they have all the living Ghostbusters to make this movie cannon.

Directed and co-written by Gil Kenan (""Monster House"", ""City of Ember"", ""A Boy Called Christmas""), it falls short of its predecessor in a mediocre follow-up that proves the series has now run its course.Two years after the events of ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"", Callie Spengler (Carrie Coon) and Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd) decide to move their family from Oklahoma to New York City. Setting up home in the old Ghostbusters' firehouse, the Spenglers work alongside the original team members Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), and Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) in an underground research lab that holds all of their captured ghosts in specially modified enclosures. One day, local resident Nadeem (Kumail Janjiani) discovers an ancient artefact that unleashes an evil supernatural energy capable of trapping the entire world in a permanent ice age. With the fate of the living now in turmoil, both the new and old Ghostbusters must set aside any generational differences to save the Earth from becoming frozen solid.After decades of patiently waiting, fans of the ""Ghostbusters"" franchise were finally treated to a third film in the series with ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"". This legacy sequel, which served as a belated continuation of the original two films, managed to find ways to appeal to the current generation while simultaneously paying respects to the older fans who made the series popular in the first place. Though not without its faults, fans such as myself found the film to be a satisfactory follow-up that left us with a good feeling after watching, which is exactly what I had hoped for leading up to its release. If it were up to me, I would have chosen to end the series here on a high note but considering its success at the box office, it was inevitable that Sony Pictures would produce more films somewhere along the pipeline. In the year of the franchise's 40th anniversary, we have ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire"", a sequel to a legacy sequel that fails to milk any fresh or exciting ideas out of this beloved series.Admittedly, the film does begin on a promising note, which I initially assumed was setting the mood for the rest of the story. In a fun opening scene, we watch as the Spengler family chase a large dragon ghost throughout the streets of Manhattan in the Ecto-1. As the spectre weaves its way through the various buildings, the Spenglers hastily try to catch it using an array of devices, including a drone with a ghost trap fitted to the top. Upon successfully bringing the creature's rampage to an end, the Spenglers are reprimanded for the collateral damage they caused in the process, later receiving a lengthy scolding from a certain environmental agent. From this point forward, the film takes a decidedly dour tone, with a general lack of excitement beyond the odd nostalgic references to the older movies. Each of the original two films had a nice blend of humour and horror that helped them become memorable staples of 80s pop culture. With this entry, however, I failed to remember even one remotely amusing part of the film once the end credits started rolling.This brings us to one of the film's biggest problems; the poor attempts at humour. Whether it's a case of weak direction, a subpar script, or a combination of both, every one of the film's comedic moments fell flat. For example, in one scene Gary tries to motivate Callie during a time where she is depressed and feels unable to continue working. He does this by quoting the lyrics to the ""Ghostbusters"" theme song, a tune anyone with even a passing knowledge of the series has heard at some point. What could have been an affectionate homage to the franchise's iconic theme becomes an awkward moment that drags on longer than it should. All the potential was there for this scene to be funny, but something felt off about the overall delivery from both Paul Rudd and Carrie Coon. The film is littered with misfired comedy just like this, which certainly puts a hamper on its already downbeat tone. In other words, what should have been cringe comedy is instead simply cringe on its own.Another problem with the film is its uninteresting story. As mentioned above, the film focuses around an ancient artefact with the ability to bring about an apocalyptic series of events. On paper, this sounds like a perfectly fine plot for a ""Ghostbusters"" film, but the execution is handled very poorly. For instance, the backstory regarding the artefact is told to the audience in a rather clunky, forced manner; by having a random character played by Patton Oswalt explain it through lengthy exposition accompanied by artistic visuals reflective of that era. Even with all that information provided, we never really feel like this is a genuine threat throughout the whole film. There's no sinister build-up, no sense of real danger, and no reason for the characters to be worried about the long term consequences of them failing their mission. As a result, I found it near impossible to become fully invested in the story this time around.However, perhaps the film's most notable undoing is in the mishandling of its characters old and new. There are simply too many character subplots intertwining at the same time that the whole film becomes cluttered. If you are going to have a film with such a large cast of characters, you better find an appropriate way to use them within the story. Unfortunately, the film fails at that in every way possible, as we are instead subjected to irrelevant plot elements that go nowhere and characters whose presence is only there for fanservice purposes only.Like in its predecessor, the film's protagonist is Phoebe (Mckenna Grace), the bespectacled young girl who follows in her grandfather's footsteps using her intellect to help capture ghosts. Yet in this film, Phoebe hardly changes all that much throughout the story, save for her desire to be taken more seriously due to her being labelled as too young to be a Ghostbuster. Her interactions with others are nothing more than surface level complaints about her age, meaning that we never really feel sorry for her on a deeper level. I assume Phoebe's character was supposed to have a more detailed arc but it was likely abandoned in favour of focusing on less important creative aspects like nostalgic fanservice.The three original ""Ghostbusters"" actors; Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Ernie Hudson, also return for another outing as their respective characters. Unfortunately, the trio seem quite unenthusiastic to be here and each look as though they are phoning in their performances. I cannot go into too much detail about their roles in the film without giving away spoilers but I felt underwhelmed by each of their contributions to the story. Still, I will admit that it is nice to see them put on their old Ghostbusters uniforms at least one more time for us, especially after four decades since their debut. There's no denying these three are only doing this film for the paycheque, so hopefully they got their money's worth out of their participation.From the perspective of a longtime fan, ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire"" is a sad reminder that some IPs are doomed to be milked for all they are worth by their distribution companies. Had the story ended at ""Afterlife"", I would have been satisfied to call the film series a trilogy, but its success has now opened the door to more byproducts of corporate greed like this one. According to some research, there are more films planned for release in the future, which has me concerned as I believe there is little else in the way of ""Ghostbusters"" lore to draw inspiration from. In my humble opinion, Sony should have quit while they were ahead, but so long as ""Ghostbusters"" remains a profitable name, things will continue in this direction for a long time.I rate it 5/10."," A mediocre follow-up that proves the series has now run its course"
"83","Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire","fishnpeas","3/10","23 March 2024","I'm a huge GB fan, saw the originals in the cinema on release and been obsessed with everything GB since then.I thought Afterlife was a fantastic follow up that honored what came before it as well as introducing new characters, they had the perfect lay up for a new set of films.Frozen Empire blows it in every way it possibly can, the script is all over the place with plot holes galore, far too many characters and story threads that go nowhere, a villain that gets literally 3 minutes of screen time, and a very creepy relationship involving children. There is not enough content for the amount of actors in the film, and people like Dan Ackroyd just feel off character because they haven't been written properly. To give you an indication of how scattered and confused this film is, they catch exactly 2 ghosts in the whole run time. Just avoid it."," If you enjoyed Afterlife, skip this one."
"84","Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire","masonsaul","7/10","23 March 2024","Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire cements that this franchise has forgotten to be a comedy which is ironic considering this is the one to feature James Acaster in a fairly substantial role. However, this is the closest these have ever come to being horror and like Afterlife, it remains a lot of fun as an Amblin throwback.The biggest issue is there's just too many characters in this one. Everyone is good, even Bill Murray obviously phoning it in. Its just doesn't succeed in the attempt to balance returning characters, the originals and some new faces, resulting in Finn Wolfhard, Celeste O'Connor and Logan Kim getting left by the wayside.Out of those who do get enough, Mckenna Grace remains a great lead and her growing relationship with Paul Rudd is the heart of this one. Kumail Nanjiani is by far the best new addition and the main source of humour here. Dan Aykroyd clearly loves returning to this character and the enthusiasm he brings is infectious.Gil Kenan's direction starts off strong with a tense opening and then adds another good car chase to this franchise. His greatest strengths lie in the darker moments with the solid atmosphere and a surprising amount of suspense for a family friendly blockbuster. Also, this generally looks nice with CG and practical effects that go further than the actual budget."," Light on comedy, surprisingly high on scares"
"85","Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire","rannynm","8/10","21 March 2024","Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is the second movie in the franchise and it is so much fun! This time, new and old Ghostbusters team up to battle an ancient demon that wants to freeze Manhattan. The special effects are mind-blowing, especially when they're chasing the icy ghosts. Also, this movie is really funny and features cool new ghostbusting gadgets and special appearances by some of the original cast members.The film is set in New York City where Phoebe Spenglar (Mckenna Grace) and her family have moved, and they are busting ghosts in the original firehouse. Ray Stantz (Dan Ackroyd) runs an occult book and antique shop. When Ray buys a strange, ancient orb that contains a dangerous and ancient spirit, the two stories collide and the old and new Ghostbusters team up to save the city.There are a ton of great things in this movie. The CGI ghosts and scenes of frozen New York City are amazing and very creative. The story is really fun because of many unexpected twists, new ghostly friends and lots of comedy. One of my favorite things about this film is that many of the original characters make appearances like when Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) tests out some new ghost-catching gadgets from his secret lab.The film's message is that it's important to work together to overcome challenges and that family can give us strength and the ability to be brave. Viewers should know it has scary moments, and that there is some light swearing.I give Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

I'm in my 50's so when I new film like this or Indiana Jones or Top Gun comes out I'm super excited to relive my teenage years for 2 hours in the cinema.Unfortunately Ghostbusters Frozen Empire didn't fulfill the excitement I was looking forward to since last summer. Yeah they've got the gang back together, yeah New York is once again at threat and as you'd expect in 2024 the special effects are superb. So it's exactly what I'd ask for isn't it?Sadly for me, it's just lacklustre which is a shame as I genuinely loved Afterlife a couple of years ago. I try not to spoil it for people yet to see a film so I won't give anything away - but there's a scene with Paul Rudd singing, you'll know exactly what I mean when you watch it. It's the most cringy and forced thing I've ever seen on film. The ""bad guy"" was great but criminally under used too.Judge for yourself though, I wouldn't like to see the film flop because as much as bringing old franchises doesn't always work sometimes we get good films and I believe Ghostbusters is a franchise worth having in the future, although maybe the old gang need to hang up their proton packs."," Who you gonna call?

"88","Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire","NonSequiturL","7/10","21 March 2024","I personally believe the original Ghostbusters is the greatest comedy of all time. True lightning in a bottle that was due to a number of factors, with the main ones being the chemistry between the cast, the setting, the innovative special effects, and the wonderfully wry screenplay that tied it all together.Afterlife was an okay attempt to bring the series into the modern age, however it fell into the ""soft reboot"" trap of excessive fan service and heavily rehashing the story of the first film to the detriment of its own identity in the franchise.Frozen Empire gives fans something more along the lines of what they really wanted from a long-belated sequel: new ghosts, new gadgets, lots of Dan Aykroyd and improved integration of the rest of the OG cast with some genuinely fun Murray moments.The setting is back in NYC as it should be (albeit CGI faked for the most part), which was sorely missing from the previous attempt. As a result, it feels much more like a proper Ghostbusters film this time around.However, it is messy and overstuffed with pointless/cringe characters, leaving the screenplay to desperately justify their presence to a ridiculous degree toward the end. There's questionable story logic (especially concerning why some characters from Afterlife are present in NYC), and your mileage may vary when it comes to the teen/family drama. Then, the villain is rushed and everything wraps up too quickly... not to mention the over reliance on CG... but in spite of all these gripes I was less offended overall than expected.If you're not a fan of the franchise, Frozen Empire won't win you over, but if you are, there's a lot to like here, in particular the mostly respectful treatment of the legacy characters. It certainly could have been far worse... and yes, we've seen far worse in recent times.If they can keep the original cast coming back, I'd be happy to watch another one of these."," Better than Afterlife"

"90","Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire","dan_slentz","4/10","22 March 2024","From ""Reel Tunez: The Radio Show All About the Movies""...What a huge disappointment! How could you have such a good cast, great history of a movie, and have such a weak story, script, and terrible directing??We know that when we expect too much from a movie, it can be a let-down. When I saw who was in this, I did have high hopes, but at no point in this movie was I ever ""wowed"".Where to start. The movie starts off without any real set-up, and it was almost like everyone assumed you'd love it from the second you saw the ""Ecto1"" (Ghostbuster ambulance).. but there really was no set-up or slightest bit of development between the last movie (Afterlife) and this one. (By the way, ""Afterlife"" was much better).For me, this is the second worst behind ""Ghostbusters Answer the Call"" (with Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, and Kate McKinnon).The big problem with this movie is the storyline just stinks! Tired, old, unsurprising. The directing was poor at best, and a ton of dumb inconsistencies (like people standing around in T-shirts outside in freezing weather.. but not cold???)Where Rick Moranis was great in the first movie as the funny bystander to all the ghostly happenings, Kumail Nanjiani was lame in his role in this movie as ""Nadeem"".The worst part is that Paul Rudd, Dan Aykroyd, and Bill Murray were nothing short of campy and hammy playing their roles. I WANTED to love these guys re-living these characters, but couldn't have been less interested in them due to the poor character writing and development on this script.No movie.. no matter what it's ""predecessor"" movie or history can ever be good if the script stinks and the direction is terrible.. and this definitely had both.Booooo! (both a ghost pun and what I thought of the movie!) I'd give ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire"" a 4 out of 10.

Gosh I'm so disappointed as I was raised watching these 80s films and they are getting ruined.I'm actually hoping that someone else takes on these films and breaths new, improved life into this franchise or just leave them to rest.I will just enjoy the 80s Ghostbusters for now until something good comes along."," DO believe the critics"
"92","Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire","nakrugt","8/10","23 March 2024","Watching a reboot of Ghostbusters requires one fundamental thing: stopping yourself from comparing the reboot with the original film.All in all, acting is nice and characters are believable. However, I think since I watched ""Killing Eve"", I found myself rooting for a character to get decapitated mercilessly throughout the film, and that character is Trevor. I mean, talk about useless characters.I totally buy the chemistry among the family members. There is no problem for me there. Another good thing was the film was not drowned in nostalgia and it gives sufficient time to our new characters to grow.However, I think they should have written off Bill Murray's character. I mean, enough already! It was not funny! It does not add anything to the story!There is one more thing I found boring watching the film, but I do not want to spoil it for everybody, so I will not mention it as it is an important plot point.Also, James Acaster is good in the film.

And this didn't start off on the right foot as 5-minutes into this travesty, I already hated it.I understand Hollywood's really trying desperately to hold onto nostalgia and legacy characters as long as they're not ghosts themselves. I just wish, like Nicole Kidman's awful AMC intro, they'd fade this chapter into the past. In fact, they've already done did this with Ghostbusters: Afterlife and introduced a slew of new/boring characters to take over the helm.Nope, they're not done yet. Every bit of this movie is ""Awww, remember when we did this (scene, music cue, bit) way better? Well, here it is again.""In this wildly dull chapter, the Ghostbustin' family is back in NYC and the same movie takes place that you saw in 1984. Only, this time with horrible and unlikeable characters who bring nothing new to the table. Also, no apologizes, I really, really hated that mother character. Just had to get that out.This movie is uneven, badly written, edited by someone blind and is obviously missing major scenes as things just...happen. The only praise I could possibly come up with is for the criminally underused Kumail Nanjiani who always makes me, at least, chuckle. With the likes of Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Patton Oswalt and Paul Rudd - all proven funny people, Nanjiani was the only one with an ounce of humor, or hope, here.I seriously don't care of there's a part 6.

"94","Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire","CountVladDracula","8/10","23 March 2024","I saw Ghostbusters Frozen Empire last night. And here is my review.It was decent but very flawed. I will list the flaws first to get them over with while I'm thinking about it.Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is the fourth film in the original Ghostbusters franchise. It mostly deals with an ancient God getting unleashed. It's kind of ironic that the first heavy snow for most of the US came on the night of this movie's release.There are many things I love about the film and I will list those last. First let's get the negative out of the way. The first is the script feels a bit confused. Some wording doesn't quite make sense, like multiple writers were trying to put the script together and didn't communicate well.I'm not too keen on the reveal that the Containment unit (where they store the captured ghosts) is just a ""giant ghost trap."" Ghostbusters: Afterlife already dealt with a ""giant ghost trap"" and it was very different. I much prefer how it was handled in The Real Ghostbusters animated series where the interior of The Containment unit was like a pocket dimension or version of limbo.I don't like the dismissive ""It was the eighties. No one was thinking about the future."" Yes, they were.I also don't like that they talk about ""disposing"" of ghosts while in the next breath it's revealed that the ""Disposing of"" is placing them in a new, bigger containment unit (with an interior ""The size of the American West."") Now that's more like the animated series version. But the wording ""disposed of"" is weird when you know they mean capture and transport.I also felt there was a bit of queer baiting with Phoebe and Melody (the ghost she befriends). There are some moments where I felt it looked like they were about to kiss. Not only that but the way Melody was introduced was off putting for me. It was almost like the audience was supposed to briefly mistake her as Egon's ghost returning and you sense that Phoebe was disappointed that it was not him.Patton Oswalt was mostly just a glorified cameo but at least he got to give useful information even if he was just an ""exposition faery.""Slimer was mostly there just to eat the other ghost called The Possessor. And how does a ghost eat another ghost? Even if Possessor was inside a pizza at the time. Wouldn't he just... go right through him? Since when is Slimer The Ghostbusters version of Kirby?I also wish there was more use of pop and rock music like in the original first two Ghostbusters movies and the use of Cruel Summer in the first trailer for Ghostbusters Frozen Empire.I also thought it was odd how easily Phoebe was tricked. I know a lot of intelligent people can be very naive but this was more than naive. It was a lampshaded (because the movie addreses how foolish she felt) ""Plot induced stupidity.""My final complaint was Phoebe's (implied to be right) deduction that when a ghost settles their unfinished business and finds peace the ghost's particle disperse and the ghost becomes ""part of the fabric of the universe."" Too me this gives too much certainty to one particular ""This is what happens after we die."" And much like the ""disposed of"" like this is sort of contradicted as well because several times it's also suggested that even the ghosts that find peace are in tact somewhere.I also couldn't quite tell if Paul Rudd's character had married Egon's daughter or not. They're obviously a couple but did they marry? If it was confirmed or not I must have missed it. I do like that Phoebe did call him Dad near the end though. That was sweet.There's a bit of a sloppiness to the writing.It also felt like the story didn't really get going until about three fourths into the movie.The writing is the weakest part of the movie but there were things and ideas that I did like. I love the idea of Winston essentially forming the Ghostbusters equivalent of The Men in Black (that's how it feels). I love his research facility. I love his tech. I love that Ray was more pro-active in this and Peter Venkman got some new, good one liners. And he actually got the function as a real (though still manipulative) parapsychologist.I love the use of practical effects. I always welcome tactile, real, old fashioned special effects over CG.I still think Phoebe is a fantastic character and love her.I do like that the new containment unit is going to be more like the version from the animated series and take up the psychic equivalent of the American West. But I still don't understand why the first containment unit was reduced to having just been ""a giant ghost trap.""I do like Winston as the Ghostbusters equivalent of Nick Fury.And I also liked that the movie had a feel to it similar to an episode of The Real Ghostbusters animated series.I am also glad for the established tradition that each movie now ends with the original Ghostbusters theme song. I hope they keep that up. It always makes me smile.I liked it but I do think it's the weakest in the original franchise. Ghostbusters: Afterlife was better. As a Ghostbusters fan I won't say it was bad. I am likely to watch it again. And I still think it's better than Ghostbusters: Answer the Call. (Pretty much anything is better than that).It's flawed but fun. It's just a decent popcorn movie.And as a life-long Ghostbusters junkie I do hope more things come from this despite all the cynical articles saying to let the franchise die.One article I saw whined about how they didn't know what demographic / target audience for the movie was. So? Who cares? I don't want a movie for a specific age group, gender, etc. I want a movie that multiple generations and people of all cultures can like. If I can say ""Oh, this movie is for twelve-year-old boys."" or ""Oh, this is for thirty-something men."" or ""This is for college age women."" i tend to get bored and see it as pandering. Just tell a good story and the audience will find it.This isn't the best Ghostbusters movie ever made but it's not the worst either. It's just the weakest of the original continuity but it is still enjoyable. I liked it."," Not as good as Afterlife but still fun"
"95","Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire","breathedirt","4/10","23 March 2024","First of all, I had a hard time looking at the lead scissors-loving girl (?) character who looked just like her brother but perhaps that was the intention: to erase any differences between girls and boys and make them ""fluid.""
Second, when the daughter called her mom by her first name and her mom's reaction to it was too soft, it was a nice display of what a modern liberal parenting can do to a child and the society.Third, incorporating a desire to become a ""ghost"" felt like some bizarre way to have teens toy with ideas pertaining to death rather than focus on how to live a happy life.Fourth, ""jokes"" about killing kids were creepy, not funny at all, and just another proof that the movie bears a ""horny"" signature straight from the fiery pits of HW.Fifth, a superficial soulless teenager making unwanted sex ""jokes"" was pure cringe.Overall, the movie lacked soul, there was no true ghost busting, the majority of ""funny"" scenes were cringeworthy and not funny at all and the writers tried very hard to communicate certain unpleasant/wrong things subliminally.

However, the sequel, the female reboot version, and the previous installment ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" I didn't care for. With this new one, the problems I have with the previous one are still here.Throughout, the production, costumes, and the special effects are pretty good as the colorful effects were well-executed. Admittledy, including some really interesting camerawork moments. The direction from Gil Kenan, while at times a bit messy, was solid on approaching some of the tone. Seeing Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Annie Potts again was fun as they still have great chemistry, charm, and dialogue dynamics between one another. Unfortunately, the new characters, bland humor, and weak narrative didn't do it for me.The characters of the original cast members are still likable and entertaining to observe but none of the new characters were interesting nor likable really. The performances from them were solid but the new characters didn't have much charm and didn't really care for them. Kumail Nanjiani's performance was kind of annoying and Paul Rudd is just being Paul Rudd, again. The dialogue is pretty rough and some of the soundtrack choices are pretty annoying. The creature and ghost designs are solid as they have some decent designs and colors, although mixed with some noticeable poor CGI. The narrative really feels like a rehash of some of the ideas from the previous movies but just with different monsters and scenes.I found myself feeling a bit bored at times.

The new cast is great, Aykroyd is great also.From the trailer you'd expect it to have more horror elements. While the big bad is very good, it's not as evil as it it could've been, which would've made the film even better.Fans will dig the film, casual moviegoers will enjoy it too, but if there's another one they are OK to ghost the classic members of the team."," Good popcorn fare that serves fans and casual movie folks"
"98","Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire","godgirlprincess","4/10","23 March 2024","If you want an agenda-free movie to see with the family - look elsewhere! I found myself holding my breath while watching with my family. It just screams lazy writing and checking boxes for the writers to romantically link underage girls, not to mention how problematic that whole idea is. A more interesting story would be a type of classic trope of growing up with one's peers as you increasingly change more of yourself just to fit in. This dynamic would fit perfectly with her trying to impress the ghost girl as a friend & peer. There was just literaly no reason to make ghost girl be a romantic interest for main girl except that it checked some boxes.

Characters are totally flat, acting is so-so (to say the best) but worst of all is the script. The story makes absolute no sense at all, full of plot holes. I know it's not a Nolan movie where everything is perfectly tied up, but here everything is resolved with finding a new character every time. Slapstick comedy is beyond awful, and the saddest part of all is the lost opportunity of making a good film, with the original cast.Afterlife despite not being the best movie at least had an emotional side, but this time the movie has, in my opinion, nothing appealing. I honestly struggle to understand people giving it a score higher than 5."," Awful"

Bustling with unforced energy from start to finish it's stands alone as a solid fantasy film even whilst standing within that hefty Ghostbusters shadow. The cast is great, with the Spengler family continuing to make these new films their own along with the surprising yet excellent addition of James Acaster as a new ""Q"" styled member of the team. Dan Akroyd beautifully ties in the nostalgia while helping to hand over the baton. With nods to the original(s) handled very well. Expect a few laughs along the way in what is an excellent story.

It's contrived.Afterlife made a half decent attempt of being the franchise back to life, but this simply trashes all the positive steps it made.You get to see some great old characters come back and do nothing.You get to see the new characters perform pointless roles in a completely under fleshed storyline, that I'm struggling to find a comparable movie where talent is so terribly wasted.It's not even worth watching to see how poor it is."," Either hate it or like it"
"104","Poor Things","lulyamy","4/10","31 March 2024","When a sequel is made, it is done for one of two reasons: the writers still have creative juices to strain, or the studio still has a cash cow to milk. A lot of movies from anywhere from 5 to 15 years ago until now have felt like the latter. The storyline of the franchise was fine where it was. There were no loose ends, and the characters were no longer in turmoil. Out of the blue another villain comes along for the sequel, and it happens again.Ghostbusters: Afterlife was not one of these. It was a charming movie and I loved all the little details, and I was wrapped up in the plot. I would not have to be dragged behind a horse to be convinced to watch it again.Frozen Empire was different. It still had charm and character, but it felt more reliant on the nostalgia of the series to keep the audience watching. In a vacuum, it's not that great of a movie. The plot isn't all too exciting, there are minor inconsistencies here and there, and it felt too formulaic and forced. The problems seem to come out of the blue, I mean, ghosts aren't normal, but past movies did a better job of explaining the threat. I probably will forget about this movie in five years and maybe won't watch it again for at least a decade. It's not a movie I enjoy so much that I still have fun the second time around. And this probably won't be the last of the franchise either, the last one was made only three years ago, and for a good movie that can be no time at all. They should take their time and put everything together right, which I know won't be what the studio wants because the original actors will be retiring soon and they probably want another movie with them in it.Now, I am certainly biased because of the upsetting trend I have seen where franchises start putting less effort into writing great stories and putting more effort into ""stunning"" visual effects. Now, with technology where it's at, we can visualize anything, it's not that big of a deal anymore. You can't hide behind a cool CGI show anymore. I don't know, it's just not hitting all the bases for me."," It was ok. Not great"

The story revolves around Phoebe and the character development is there. I also think Paul Rudd fits Ghostbusters perfectly. Dan Ackroyd / Ray was amazing as ever and Winston and Venkman make appearances for good measure. This is the first time I have ever gone to the cinema alone as I wanted to see this film.

Then, the characters pile up, action draws to a close and we're doled out a frankly dumb and patronising parenting sub-plot, within not much of a plot. Whatever happened to escapism in cinema? Paul Rudd is supremely irritating as the kooky everyman, Carrie Coon uncharismatic and an ensemble of work-in-progress teen actors are each vying for attention like they're in a school play. Each dialed-in witticism sinks without trace. Dan Ackroyd is probably the most compelling force in the movie, but you can't rely on one seasoned actor to do the heavy lifting. The 2016 reboot had far more swagger and intelligence than this.Finale was meh and effects-wise, seemed like the budget had been exhausted by the ridiculously extended payroll.Nope.

"119","Poor Things","silverjbohn","8/10","1 April 2024","*Spoiler alert* As someone who absolutely loved Afterlife and all previous Ghostbuster movies with a passion, I was terribly disappointed in this lazily written and poorly executed sequel. It felt like the movie needed an extra 30-45 minutes to truly develop the storyline and characters but never got there. Bill Murray was palpably unenthusiastic and Dan Akroyd was okay at best. The billionaire philanthropist, Winston Zeddemore, created a state-of-the-art ghost jail and research facility, and then apparently proceeded to hire a child and stereotypical science nerd to run the place, while simultaneously forgetting to install a security system, hire a guard, or install a backup power generation system which the entire place relied on to keep ghosts in their cells. The villain, ""Garraka"", was too graphic for younger audience members, while also lacking any real depth as a bad guy. Its always puzzling that these ancient souls existed before the earliest known languages, but somehow manage to speak modern English at the same time. The final battle resulted in most of the characters being frozen, yet miraculously reanimating just in time for the final battle. The containment system which blew up and released every ghost ever caught was also somehow turned into the trap that caught Garraka. No real conclusion as to what happened to all the other ghosts that were released as we are to assume they were just magically trapped at the same time even though they were assumedly spread out all over the tristate area. To wrap this up, even though I could go on, the manner in which Phoebe melted down brass using a handheld torch and then proceeded to pour it over the particle accelerator without any collateral damage to any of the other sensitive components was laughably dumb and completely unbelievable. Honestly, the rare moments I caught myself enjoying this movie were the moments when Kumail would seemingly join me in my disbelief of the nonsense they were trying to sell us. His comedic performance saved this movie from being a total failure, even though his character somehow mastering the ancient magic skill of being a fire master went from not believing in it at all, to him struggling to light a candle, to defeating Garraka within the span of a few hours. I truly hope the franchise doesn't become another Marvel-esque cash-grab, but if this film was any clue, I have low expectations for future sequels but hope they will use the same formula as Afterlife if they do."," Imaginative and beautiful"

Then there are the ok sequels, Hangover 2 is ok but the first one was the better one, Ghostbusters 1 is superior to 2, two was ok but it lacked that initial punch of the first one and Frozen Empire is the same. It has some good bits, some not so good bits and a few pacing issues. Good bits Ray and the gang are in it some funny jokes, the bad bits too much teenage drama and hints of ghost busting without really seeing it (dunno if this is budget related) not enough Bill Murray. Pacing at times was ... teenager drama driven and dragged down the pace. On the whole a good film and that's been hard to say with the tripe pushed out of Hollywood of late, but it lacks that feeling when we saw the good by to Harold in afterlife which was a good and fitting way to send off the one half of the original creator of a beloved movie series.

Especially the return of the old ghost busters and the iconic theme song was pretty well done. But it would be hard to do anything wrong with that.For me, everything else was very mediocre. The storyline felt very slow and when it finally began to be exciting, it was cut short and the movie ended.The movie honestly failed to make me feel connected to the newer characters. The cast wasn't too bad but actors like Finn Wolfhard, who are only known for one big role, are often not a great choice for another franchise movie, because they're always kind of ""that one character"" (There are many famous exceptions like Margot Robbie or Christian Bale, who can do great performances while not being known for one role). I think a rather unknown actor would've been a better choice, but maybe they just needed to target a certain fan base.Also, the entire storyline between Melody and Fibi kind of felt like it was only there to have the plot make sense.I think the movie is definitely a fun time, especially if you're a fan of the original, but it's mostly built on nostalgia and not too great."," A good movie, not excepcional but excellent performance of Emma Stone"

"127","Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","5/10","23 January 2024","Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only na√Øve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly na√Øve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fianc√©e, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."," Turns out the real poor things were the audience all along."

I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide.

"129","Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","1/10","12 March 2024","A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."," Pompous and Grotesque"
"130","Poor Things","kjproulx","10/10","6 January 2024","For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."," The Weirdest Masterpiece I've Seen in Many Years"

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"," Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating."

I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater.

"133","Poor Things","pd-19490","1/10","20 January 2024","The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

"134","Poor Things","aciessi","9/10","24 December 2023","If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."," A Bizarre Masterpiece"
"135","Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","1/10","27 February 2024","There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar No√© and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting p√∏rnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."," What did I just watch?"

They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting.

"137","Poor Things","doppleganger19692","5/10","8 February 2024","I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that.

"138","Poor Things","nicolasroop","9/10","22 December 2023","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."," One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!"

There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here.

"141","Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","9/10","22 January 2024","Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."," An Unconventional Mind"

""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating.

The director had already addressed a similar theme in the film ""Dogtooth."" The performances are excellent, representing the best moments in the careers of Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo, who play their roles very well here. Another highlight is the construction of retrofuturistic-style settings, full of references, such as metropolises, which blend intentionally simple visual effects with high-quality effects, constantly creating a sense of suspicion.The photography seeks open and dystopian angles, and the controversial scenes involving sex are not explained but are very well directed. The film starts with a premise in the best science fiction style but traverses various genres, including horror, comedy, romance, and drama, forming a complete work. Despite being far from perfect, in a period of repetitions and little creativity, Yorgos Lanthimos draws inspiration from a little-known book from the 90s to create a timeless film.

"146","Poor Things","arungeorge13","9/10","29 February 2024","A few things I felt while watching Poor Things:1. There are so many quotable lines sprinkled throughout the film. They come from both the protagonists as well as the supporting characters. Lines like ""Why keep it in my mouth if it is revolting?"", ""We are all on a ship and cannot escape. And there is a world to enjoy, traverse, circumnavigate.."" and many, many more will just hit you out of the blue and keep you furious-jumping (wink!) from idea to idea. The same weirdness will unexpectedly leave you in splits during several scenes.2. Emma Stone (as the resuscitated Bella Baxter) showcases a myriad of emotions throughout. She is, at once, the horniest woman you'll see and the most (instantly) caring human being breaking down at the plight of the slums she sees in Alexandria. She is fully transparent, has zero emotional filters, and speaks like a child but with the questionable intelligence of a growing adult. Stone is an absolute joy to watch on screen, and the writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos bestows upon her a unique, original character with the potential to go wild in any direction she chooses. It's absolutely bonkers to see how this character evolves, all subtext included.3. With a $35 million budget (i.e. 1/4th of that of Barbie), Lanthimos creates outright magic on screen. Cinematographer Robbie Ryan uses the fisheye lens to incredible effect; it creates a world that needs to be just as vast & distorted yet intriguing as Bella's. Also, when he zooms in on Stone's face, it is equally fascinating. There are repetitive, repulsive shots of surgeries taking place at (eccentric) surgeon Dr. Godwin's (Willem Dafoe) ""experimental"" workplace and they remarkably do their job (of making us feel disgusted, i.e.). The art department meticulously constructs Bella's world of sexual exploration, philosophy, poverty, abandonment, empathy, choices, perversion, and eventually, redemption.4. I really enjoyed Mark Ruffalo's and Willem Dafoe's performances. The former is a playboy who turns possessive (~the transition is fun to watch~), while the latter is constantly experimenting with his test subjects. His matter-of-fact exchanges with a medical student (Ramy Youssef), who initially takes a liking to Bella, is riveting. Oh, and Dafoe's character expels burp bubbles (if his disfigured face wasn't bizarre enough). Lanthimos left no stone unturned, haha.5. The score (Jerskin Fendrix) is almost like you stepped into a carnival (of one). Very often it's a single, discernible instrument playing a recurrent note, yet so sharply effective. There are exceptions, of course.. such as the spontaneous dancing segment with Bella and Duncan, the scene where a colleague-turned-friend is orgasming her, or when she's heartbroken seeing babies dying.6. Poor Things ends on a high, and even carries a sort of knockout punch. Lanthimos slickly and carefully builds to this specific moment, offering the character of Bella Baxter and the people who adore/support her, a delightfully twisted version of ""happily ever after"". WHAT. A. FILM!"," It's an ""original"" experience, as is most of Lanthimos' works! [+85%]"
"147","Poor Things","Lepidopterous_","9/10","8 December 2023","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."," An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity"
"148","Poor Things","garethcrook","9/10","23 March 2024","From the very first frame you can tell that Yorgos Lanthimos is going to take you on a fantastic ride. Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) is in the care of mad scientist Goodwin (Willem Dafoe). We meet them in opulent black and white surreal surroundings, half shot with a fish eye lens. When I say surreal I mean literally as a dog with a ducks head follows Bella around the house. Goodwin likes putting things back together. Bella likes breaking them. She's learning you see. A young woman, she's the mental capacity of a toddler. Goodwin is loving, if not always responsible, a product of his tortured childhood, his understanding of love is somewhat... altered. Max (Ramy Youssef) an eager student in Goodwin's macabre surgical classes is invited to help on a project, Bella. Despite its grotesque Victoriana, it's sweet. Bella, innocent and fearless, is trying to find her way. It's quite a story and wastes no time. Goodwins controlled world for Bella is complex and a little terrifying. She's an experiment and Max doesn't really approve. Especially when he learns of how Bella monstrously came to be. Never the less, Max falls for Bella, which complicates things with the arrival of Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo). He's not a nice bloke, but he offers freedom and Bella is hell bent on grabbing it. The men here are the poor things. They underestimate Bella's veracious capacity and curiosity for life and life in a Lanthimos film offers much to be curious of. Every frame is packed with metaphor and mystery. I feel like I could watch this ten times over back to back and still find something different each time. As Bella explores, her world is saturated with colour in hyper fantastic scenes that explode from the screen in much the way Bella does. She has no filter, acts on pure instinct. Loves the things she likes, cares little for those she doesn't, like a crying child in a restaurant, ""I must go punch that baby"". Witty, satirical, bloody hilarious. It's easy to enjoy, but you have to embrace it. It's a decedent trip, but the crafted visuals mask its real majesty. Who are we, what are we, why are we. As Bella's eyes are opened, ours of focused. Stone is magnificent, her character commands every scene and she carries it with ease. Ruffalo is great too and Dafoe even with the easy win of fantastic make up delivers a typically magnetic performance. It's lavish, but doesn't make anything hard to follow. Allow it and it's quite accessible. A feast for the eyes and the mind, with a cast of characters blessed with hidden depth. I really wasn't expecting to love this as much as I did. It's a must watch for any fan of cinema, for anyone at all in fact. A rollercoaster with a delightful sting in its tail. We should all be more Bella."," Magnificent."
"149","Poor Things","okpilak","9/10","24 March 2024","This is both odd and brilliant at the same time. The four Oscars it won are well deserved. Bella (Emma Stone) carries the role perfectly. The sets, such as the house of Doctor Godwin Baxter are quite a sight, as well as the places and even the ship Bella and Duncan Wedderburn travel to and on. Bella committed suicide, and Doctor Godwin reanimates the dead. But since she committed suicide, he didn't want to reanimate her with her memories that drove her to suicide, so he replaces her brain with that of an infant. So we see her in the early stages of learning to do things. Max McCandles, a medical student is brought in by Doctor Godwin to monitor and record her progress as she learns to do things. He is to be betrothed to Bella, and Duncan Wedderburn is brought in to finalize a marriage contract. Not knowing anything about Bella, he decides to run off with her. And Bella certainly learns a lot of new things that she finds really wonderful. The sets are quite intriguing, with a lot of color saturation which gives some scenes an unworldly aspect. It is really a movie that has to be seen to be appreciated, as it is so offbeat mere words cannot adequately describe it. But it also is not for everyone. The hybrid animals roaming the Godwin estate are truly unique."," Not your typical movie"
"150","Poor Things","JoshuaMercott","9/10","1 March 2024","This was one of the best twists on the classic Frankenstein story I've ever seen. A seemingly mad scientist brought a woman to life and she started to evolve in distinctly human ways.Suffice to say, ""Poor Things"" was rife with rich subtext and not a small amount of Shakespearean theatricality. It was as if a mirror had been raised to humankind and it caught us digging our noses.Emma Stone as Bella Baxter was practically a force of nature. Not a single frame in which she featured was less than outstanding. She took what amounted to a cartoony character and made her seem like all of us. Man or woman, no matter, we were all Bella Baxter at some point in our lives. Some still are.Willem Dafoe as Dr. Godwin Baxter contributed a performance that was equal parts memorable and unnerving. In addition to stellar makeup, his presence brought with it a rare cinematic gravitas that has to be seen to be appreciated.Adapted from the novel (published, 1992) by Alasdair Gray, ""Poor Things"" took the best of both worlds - books and movies - to create a captivating niche in visual storytelling.Bella Baxter's child-like naivet√© was surprisingly contrasted by a sharp and witty outlook of the world around her. This made me feel so many things at once, especially as a writer. I couldn't help but confirm that Bella Baxter's literary craftsmanship was certainly supreme, and it beautifully carried over into the movie.Now, Dr. Godwin Baxter found Bella's drowned (by suicide) body (which was also pregnant) and applied his nuanced (eerily so) medical prowess to bring her back.But instead of the woman who existed before the unfortunate incident, the new Bella gained the mind of a child (her own unborn one, to be exact) but retained the needs of a nymphomaniac (which her former self was known for).This controversial plot-point was a fascinating and bold element in the ""Poor Things"" movie adaptation. Though I'm yet to read the book, I believe this trait was essential or the whole story would've fallen flat.Assisting the ""monster"" doctor was Max McCandles (played by Ramy Youssef). The more he helped track Bella's progress - believing her to be a random mentally challenged person - the more he and she grew close. This eventually led to some serious future ideations, especially with the doctor who 'created' her.Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn added to the madness. Between his accent and his appetite, it was impressive to see a new side to the actor whose skills have always been more wide-reaching than his relatively simple MCU portrayal of the Hulk.After a while, Bella ended up going into the world and inadvertently encountering people who knew the past her. That's when the proverbial brown stuff hit the fan and the movie started to take an ominous and suspenseful turn.Love, sex, desire, curiosity, morality, freedom, empowerment, expression... These were just a few of the many human traits and tropes ""Poor Things"" packed with the finesse of a seasoned traveller. The movie was grotesque yet great. It contained everything needed to make Bella's journey an unforgettable trip."," Grotesque Yet Great"
"151","Road House","jklein8787","9/10","8 July 2004","God, what a great film. Maybe one of the funniest films. The movie tries way too hard to be a ""guy"" flick and it boarders as being homoerotic. Seeing Swayze almost nude doing karate as an old Uncle Jesse looking guy watches him is just creepy. Swayze is Dalton, a guy who thinks pain doesn't hurt, a guy who can rip your throat out with his bare hands, a guy who can kick your ass and then take home Kelly Lynch and bang her the same night. Dalton is trying to clean up the Double Duce, a rough bar where the patrons aren't very friendly. The dialog is brilliant! We get lines like, ""I f--- guys like you in prison!"" ""The Double Douche?"" ""Come on, chicken dick!"" ""You're too stupid to have a good time."" ""God, I love the way Don Knots makes love."" The movie has tons of violence, a bar fight every 15 min. or so. Boobs flop around alot too and for the women and Shawn, Swayze shows his buns. Ben Gazzara as the bad guy chews his scenery like Adam with wings. It's a very fun film and if you don't take it too seriously, you'll enjoy it. If you liked Sense and Sensibility, you'll enjoy Road House!"," Hilarious accidentally"
"152","Road House","dgrahamwatson","9/10","31 August 2007","When you have a film where the men display their toned biceps by rolling up their sleeves, don a mullet hairstyle and the women wear micro skirts with big hair you know that this is the quite essential 80's movie. Top billing here is Patrick Swayze who was in big demand at this time by Hollywood, was able to put to to good use his physical dexterity and dancing skills to to play a martial arts expert who is a head bouncer in this testosterone laden movie. There are a lot of good character actors in support, some great dialog and plenty of brawls to keep your attention.It's mostly a guy movie but it has it's chick moments although their contribution is not really very memorable,however more importantly it's a good verses evil movie! It's not a new concept there have been many similar themes over the years and the one that in many ways stands out was the 1950's western "" Shane"". It very much resembled this i.e. a new kid in town who stands up to the local heavy and mobilizes and encourages the terrified locals to aid him!Personally I never cared for bouncers, I used to enjoy provoking them just to see how far I could get before they got violent, also I witnessed a fight outside a club once where the bouncers themselves were badly beaten up by some thugs, therefor this movie aroused my attention. Patrick Swayze plays Dalton who has a reputation in the night club scene as a top ""cooler"". This position is somebody who over sees the bouncers and make sure that nobody gets out of line. Although he has a degree in philosophy, Dalton uses his martial arts skills to work in the night club business and consequently gets head-hunted by a club owner from a small town in Kentucky who persuades Dalton to help him clean up a night spot called the ""Double Duce"". The only condition Dalton insists on is that he gets well remunerated (he gets what he wants - no negotiation!) and demands cart blanche i.e. what he says goes and he has the final word!After driving down (he doesn't fly , it's too dangerous -- how ironic!) and after visiting the club he realizes that this place is a slaughterhouse that will only attract trouble makes and low-lives. He soon gets up to speed and marks the thugs and decides that some of the bouncers themselves who relish the violence are as much a part of the problem as anything else, (not at all unusual by the way). Dalton soon assets himself and starts to sort things out and get rid of the bad apples the the place starts to resemble a reasonable night spot.However, what the owner doesn't tell Dalton is that the town itself is run by a local hood and entrepreneur Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) aided and abetted by his hired muscle. Not only does Wesley have relatives that have been fired by Dalton but he also has designs on the club it self. Wesley soon realizes that Dalton is not some Johnny come lately and nor will not be a push over because after a couple of encounters with Dalton and his newly trained bouncers his goons come off second best.When Dalton cannot be bought off or reasoned with into joining his organization, he lets his top enforcer the intimidating Jimmy (Marshall Teague)off the leash to really crank up the pressure. Dalton realizes that he's going to need help and asks legendary cooler Wade Garret (Sam Elliot) to join him down at the Double Duce. What makes it even more complicated and really irks Wesley is that one of his former girlfriends who has not only rejected him but takes a fancy to Dalton, so Wesley tries to get to him by using his morality and good conscience against him.By intimidating the locals by destroying their businesses he hopes to turn the locals against him or else force Dalton into leave town as to save their livelihoods. Dalton does not back down and up to this point it's just gratuitous violence and intimidation, however after a show down between Jimmy and Dalton that results in a shocking conclusion, all bets are off and killing and burning down buildings are now fair game.Never the less it's great entertainment, enjoyable to watch although you shouldn't take it too seriously. Two things to point out: there is not a cop to be seen in this movie until the very end, also special mention has to go to one of Wesley's henchman the hapless O'Conner who was not only twice on the receiving end of a Dalton beating but also suffered the indignity of a public dressing down and got slapped about by Wesley. This was for not measuring up to what Wesley had come to expect from his men as well as the inability to endure pain! Never the less there he is at the end still working for Wesley, the unemployment line would surly have been a better option at this stage! Well there you have it, grab the pop corn sit back and enjoy Dalton and co take out the trash and send people to barbers college!!"," ""Just watch my back and watch each others , - - - - and take out the trash!!"""

"154","Road House","Sinamon","9/10","15 July 1999","Road House is without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen... though I fear it's not for the reasons those who made it would have liked. Patrick Swayze's portrayal of a cold, ninja-kicking bouncer is hysterical. The fact that nobody respects him until he kicks the sh** out of them is his best character trait. Sam Elliot's stiff-as-wood performance as Wade Garrett, the aging bouncer is the stuff of legend. All the while, stealing the show with his delicately homo-erotic performance as Swayze's nemesis is Jimmy, who's down-right silly stare-down scene with the star will leave you on the floor. He is simply breath-taking. I can't remember the last time I laughed at a villain so much.The best line in the film is when Jimmy brags about his sexual exploits while in prison, as a tool of intimidation while duking it out with Dalton. Make sure you are not eating or drinking anything while watching this, it will certainly end up all over you. All in all, a good time."," I thought you'd be bigger"
"155","Road House","A_Different_Drummer","9/10","14 April 2014","There is a theory among film students that every decade brings with it a new style, a new look in feature film. And there is a lot to said for that. The 50s for example blew away the class and prestige of the 40s with an endless strong of (unintentionally) horrific B-movies aimed at kids. The 60s, as a courtesy to the reader, we will not even discuss. The 70s as a film decade is almost always conspicuously absent from the curriculum in most film schools, and that in itself speaks volumes. Which brings us to the 80s. Road House is very 80s. It is almost as though both the audience and the producers were so fascinated with each other that neither could get enough of seeing themselves, watching themselves, observing themselves on screen. I gave this a 9 and will stick to it. Escapism so pure you almost need to cut it with baby powder. Of course, 99% of the impact is Swayze, but you already knew that. Two years after Dirty Dancing, with his charisma at its peak, he pretty much steals the film. Oddly, there are major pacing problems, it is one of those films that is much more fun at the beginning than later on in the ""big reveal."" And for reasons that escape me (money) Ben Gazzara, an A-List actor who had distinguished himself in ANATOMY OF A MURDER and and QB7 (the first-ever mini-series) chose to lose himself in a caricature of a caricature of a caricature.

Without doing much, Dalton attracted all the women around him.Everyone has a part contributing to the whole story.The doctor at first glimpse was the eye candy, but turned out to be the second guessing voice of Dalton's personality. She balanced Dalton's death wish attitude into a more grounded person.Gazzara played one heck of a villain. A type of villain who would take anything coz he simply could. Not because he defined himself as a villain, but as a powerful rich man trying to keep his territory only for himself.Frank, or Frankie in the new version, represented the voice of the community. When pushed too far, community stroke back with a vengeance. A warning for today's power olay every where in America.

Cool.Dalton is the best bouncer in the biz. He's headhunted to come work at a rowdy bar, The Double Deuce (double because a single deuce is something nasty in US slang, I assume). ""5,000 upfront and 500 a night. You pay all medical expenses."" The hiring boss agrees. The bar must be in dire straits.Dalton arrives and this is not, not that country club from Dirty Dancing. It's more like a themed biker bar, never a dull moment, bottles smashed, cheap cracks and groping the waitresses, and a wire fence to protect the band from missiles. A new assignment for the best bouncer in the biz, not forgetting mentor Wade Garrett, mind. (Deep voice) In a world, where bouncers are famous and hero-worshipped, one man will...whatever. He's soon onto his third car in half an hour, which reminds me that Roger Ebert called Road House a 'drive-in' movie. Do drive-ins still exist in the US? I hope so. In Dalton's world, you need a spare car to take all the payback thrown your way for doing your job too well. Pride gets hurt and tyres get slashed.Dalton sets to work retraining the staff and cleaning up the bar, much to annoyance of a local businessman / thug Brad Wesley, who brings on heavier and heavier crews to try and undo Dalton's good work. Fortunately, Dalton isn't completely alone, not once Wade rolls into town about halfway through. Man! This guy's way cooler than Dalton. Stuff the lousy Double Deuce. Let's just mosey on down the highway with Wade, see what he does. Ah, if only the screenwriters had been so kind. Alas, we must play out this endearingly far-fetched drama of escalating violence, abs, pneumatic hard bodies, and rockin' good blues music, to its big bear of a conclusion (a scene probably remotely inspired by Enter The Dragon).Road House rebooted (2024) is getting mixed reviews, and no surprise, these reboots are always reheated and overly processed fare.

"176","Road House","TOMASBBloodhound","10/10","14 November 2004","What brilliant trash this film is! It works absolutely every time! For all I know it was filmed either at Uncle Ron's or El Matador here in town!Road House is the story of a bouncer hired to clean up a rough bar in a tiny town. He isn't just your ordinary illiterate muscle head, though. It's Patrick Swayze. He's got a degree in philosophy from NYU! He owns a Mercedes! Why, he's the best damn cooler in the business! And it's a good thing he is. This fictional town of Jasper, MO is dominated by a slimy Boss-Hogg type played by Ben Gazzara. He and his thugs skim money from every business in town, and the last thing they want is some stranger waltzing on to the scene to break up their control of the action. Enough plot, though. Let's focus on the highlights.This film has a script that should be bronzed or put on display at the Smithsonian. We get monumental lines such as:""It's good to see you!"" spoken by a blind man when he first greets Swayze.""What do you take me for?"" a bimbo asks another bar patron in an early scene. the reply- ""About a hundred dollars!""And this film also contains the greatest line ever spoken in the history of cinema. Decorum prohibits me from stating it verbatim, but you'll probably know it when you hear it. It's spoken by pro wrestler Terry Funk who plays the bouncer Swayze replaces. The line focuses on the supposed size of Swayze's package, and the size vehicle his seed could fill.The film is filled with bar fights that eventually turn into shootouts, hot women, fast cars, monster trucks, explosions, you name it. Anything for guys who like movies is in abundance. The whole thing plays out like a typical night on the town for us yokels here in the red states.The film comes in surprisingly long at 114 minutes, but don't worry. This is the type of film you can basically stop at any place, then push play when you and your friends get back from the bars. ""It will be like you never left,"" as Christopher Lloyd tells Michael J. Fox at one point in Back to the Future. The film has more than its share of logical lapses. As Roger Ebert points out in his review, there is no way anyone could get as rich as Wesley by skimming this little town. It seems to only have a bar, an auto parts store, a Ford dealership, and a cafe or two. Most of these places get wiped out as the action unfolds. It makes you wonder who would have been left for Wesley to skim from. But criticism of a film like this is useless. When faced with such an artistic statement as Road House, one can either sit back and enjoy, or chuck the tape out the window. 10 of 10 stars.The genius of Joel Silver my know no boundaries.Added 9-14-2009: We'll see you on the other side, Patrick!

Armed with incredible tai chi skills, Dalton completes his task, but runs afoul of Brad Wesley, the evilest man in Jasper, Mo.Dalton soon realizes even his tai chi skills won't be enough to defeat the ascot sporting Wesley, or his army of monster truck driving, booze bottle smashing henchmen, so Dalton is forced to call in his mentor Wade Garrett (the world's greatest, or second greatest cooler, depending on who you ask)to help him defeat the forces of evil.Will Dalton and Wade prevail? Will Brad Wesley continue to finance his evil empire by shaking down the three businessmen that operate in Jasper? All I can tell you is this--Don't be too stupid to have a good time.

"179","Road House","ivo-cobra8","10/10","10 October 2016","Road House (1989) is my personal favorite number 1 film from Patrick Swayze. This film stands alone as Patrick Swayze's best work in my opinion. It is an action classic that I grew up with it, I am a fan of Patrick Swayze and I can say it is his best action film! I love this film I grew up watching it as a kid. It is my third favorite Patrick Swayze movie and It is a action martial arts classic childhood! I love this film to death I love it so damn much and I love Steel Dawn and Black Dog to death the same as I love Road House. Road House will always be his best film he work with it. I can say Nomad, Dalton and Jack Crews are Patrick's favorite characters of mine he ever played! My mom loved to watching him in her favorite miniseries North and South it was her favorite show that she talked about with me.Plot: Dalton (Patrick Swayze) is the best bar bouncer in the business, but he's anything but ""typical."" He's a little small for his trade, has a degree in philosophy and he believes in ""being nice."" But when he's hired to clean up the Double Deuce in the small town of Jasper, he's pushed to his breaking point. Discovering Jasper is controlled by an evil sadist (Ben Gazzara) who doesn't want anyone meddling with ""his"" town. After he sends his goons to bust up the Double Deuce, all hell breaks loose. Now it's ""no more nice guy"" for Dalton as he starts busting heads, leading him to the all-time, no-holds-barred, butt whooping showdown of the century.There is a lot of action in this film, a lot of kickboxing and a lot's of fights in it. Patrick Swayze does a really good fight scenes, I think Patrick Swayze does really good job with a fight scenes, he does very solid job I mean really bottom in my heart I really miss Patrick Swayze I really do, that he is no longer with us. Road House is my favorite film, it has a lot of action and kickboxing fight scenes, Patrick Swayze does a really good job playing a hero for an late 80's action flick it is pretty good and I love it. It is definitely my favorite Patrick Swayze film. Road House is a film that I will always cherish and I definitely don't agree with people who doesn't like this film.You have an epic martial art's fight between Dalton (Swayze) and Jimmy (Marshall Teague) watch the fight carefully Dalton uses eagle claws technique when kills Jimmy. The choreography is a mix of various martial art styles evident in the variety of locks, throws, kicks and punches as used in Kickboxing, Hapkido and Jujitsu, with a particularly impressive flying kick from Swayze himself. The grueling work put in by the actors is visible in their strained expressions adding that no-holds-barred street fight feel to a fight scene packed with some excellent technical maneuvers.I love the beautiful music score on the end of the film When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky by The Jeff Healey Band which is very beautiful song on the end of the credits. I love the final showdown between Dalton and Wesley on the end of the movie and the happy ending.This film is directed by Rowdy Herrington who made some pretty good movies that I like, Gladiator and Striking Distance with Bruce Willis which is definitely my Bruce Willis's favorite action thriller film. The rest of the cast did also good job, Sam Elliott also did a terrific support cast, the same as actor Ben Gazzara as the villain who is sadly no longer with us anymore. Kelly Lynch was also good as Swayze's love interest. I am hearing that Nick Cassavetes is planning a remake about this film which it is unnecessary. There was a sequel about this film that I don't care for.R.I.P. - Patrick Swayze (1952 - 2009) I really miss you so much and I wish you could do more bad ass action movies, I am your biggest fan and so was my mom we all miss you and we all love you, I love you to death! Road House (why doesn't THAT film get the cult/appreciation/notice of this POS), Uncommon Valor, Steel Dawn (underrated) and Black Dog are my top 4 favorite Patrick Swayze movies he ever did!

A lady doctor? I too dream of a time when such a ridiculous thing is possible.There is even a subtle tongue in cheek head nod to the USA's skyrocketing healthcare disaster, whereby Dalton while undergoing treatment forgoes the use of local anesthetic, presumably due to its astronomical cost.""Pain don't hurt."" he nonsensically quips, obviously delirious and suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy due to his extensive history of brain trauma.Oh Swayze you magnificence fool, pain does hurt. It hurts alot... What have they done to you?Also there's that one scene where Daltons like bam and completely just rips that guys throat out with his bare hands, like in Rambo. So killer.Road House, is still as relevant and politically compelling as it was the day it was made. It's gritty, it's in your face and it's uncomfortable. (I lied about the lady doctor thing, the mere thought of it makes me uncomfortable.)Sure, its can be a little too intellectual for some; a little bit pretentious and some could argue, conceptually grandiose.But so what?Road house in essence is an artistic masterpiece, and as with all good art, it stakes you down and rakes your psyche over the hot coals of morality and dares you to ask the hard questions.Questions like:
Whats the deal with society, am I right?
Where are all the black people in this movie?
Why havent I spent more time on a lake practising shirtless oiled up Tai Chi to enhance my street fighting abilities?
Damn, why Swayze smoke so much?Road House is cinema at its finest, raw, edgy and technically magnificent, all factors which culminate in it's unarguable pride of place in the zeitgeist, and in the hearts of people who still have fake fights with imaginary baddies in the shower with super realistic noise effects and oscar worthy dialogue.12/5 80's boobs"," Complex and evocative."
"187","Road House","WilderMovieReviews","10/10","17 May 2012","So what kind of film do you get when you have great one liners, bar fights, guns, knives, egos, strippers, blues music, a polar bear and a monster truck? You get one of the most enjoyable and entertaining films of the late 80's, Road House. The film follows James Dalton (Patrick Swayze) a cooler (bouncer) and the best in the business, as he takes employment with Frank Tilghman (Kevin Tighe) the owner of the Double Deuce in Jasper, Missouri. The bar is the roughest in town and he needs Dalton to clean it up. However corrupt business man and crime boss Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) stands in his way. After the classic ""chick flick"" Dirty Dancing, Patrick Swayze was Hollywood gold. Women loved him and men wanted to be him. The film was full of romance. Then along came Road House, a complete opposite to Dirty Dancing, a little romance and loads of action. The film has a great cast including Patrick Swayze, Kevin Tighe, Ben Gazzara, Kelly Lynch, Marshall R. Teague, Red West, Kathleen Wilhoite, John William Young, John Doe, Kurt James Stefka, Keith David & Terry Funk. The cast works well together and it is full of great performances. Naturally Patrick Swayze at the height of his career stands miles apart from the rest of the cast as Dalton. A character that can hurt you with his words just as much as his fists. Tragically, 20 years later Swayze had his life cut short by cancer. His death is still a major loss to the entertainment industry, but his legacy will live on in the great performances and memorable characters he played. The film also a features a great performance by the late great blues guitarist Jeff Healey as Cody. It's the music in the film that goes a long way to achieving the right feel for the film. Everything works well from the characters, the music to the setting. Set in a rural area the scenery is breath-taking and it is used to great effect. But it's the fight choreography that stands out from many other films. Great bar fights are pretty much a thing of the past, but here they are full of action and humour just like the classic westerns. The one on one fights are brutal, mainly for the realism they portray. The script is awesome and full of classic lines mainly from Dalton and although many are cheesy, when he says it, it feels right. The director surprisingly hasn't made many films but the ones I have seen of his I really like and I know I am in the minority. See my review of Gladiator (1992) for more by this director. This is truly a great film, although very underrated. It is also one of my personal all-time favourites. There are a couple of versions of this so ensure that you see the USA or UK version released after 2002 as these are the uncut editions. So grab a few beers and a few friends, but this on a big screen and turn the sound way up for a really great movie experience.10 out of 10"," Very underrated"
