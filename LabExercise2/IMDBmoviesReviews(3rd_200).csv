"1","Immaculate","jenhfa","4/10","26 March 2024","After reading the reviews, I bought tickets to experience this movie. I went in thinking that this movie was going to be good but it turned out to be mediocre, at best.Typical story of a girl who was recruited to a convent and moved from the US to Italy. After taking her vows, she blacks out from drinking too much wine at the communion. So far, no red flags yet...As the movie progresses, we learn that she's a virgin Mary and has miraculously conceived. Nuns begin to praise her and start worshipping her. Again, no red flags.The movie continues to go downhill from there, and not in a good way. A couple of jump scares is what you have to expect. This is just another rewriting of Rosemary's Baby but not as good.Skip this movie."," Meh"
"2","Immaculate","Simonus1991","5/10","1 April 2024","Not a complicated movie, nor a special horror movie within the genre of horror/thriller/gore horror etc.It has intriguing aspects to show in the beginning; it's the classic premise of being in some christian environment with orthodox rules to follow, where freedom is a definition unheard of, especially for nuns for that matter in a place like that. The movie wants to suggest how patriarchal the environment is, and how women are held in some prison, from which there is no way out but only by following the rules of men.I have a strong negative feeling that this is another feminist movie that is not necessarily against men in general, but against the conservative worldviews and probably against christianity itself, that latter holds the importance of strongly think about miscarry a child to be born and having the false claim of not having the option for a woman/the mother to have a say in such matter whatsoever.Are we really living in a society, in America, or in Europe, where no discussions can be held about such serious matter, or we just have to endure another falsely claimed argument about it through a motion picture like this, the Immaculate?"," Primitive way of make a statement about abortion"
"3","Immaculate","mrsldearing","5/10","1 April 2024","The film Started off ok a quite believable actress although we've seen a lot of nun/ religious films in the past none quite grip us anymore the plot was quite intriguing the story not too bad although not at all scary worst of all the ending was so bad we wished we hadn't bothered. Shoulda shown the baby no matter how hideous the screaming was over the top the acting was poor shame as this could have been a good story but once again another film tries to be frightening but isn't
Maybe one day someone will come up with an excorcist or an omen or even the nun that will truly scare the horror going people of this world."," Terrible ending"
"4","Immaculate","johnathanayotte","8/10","24 March 2024","The movie starts off strong, you're introduced soon to the leading protagonist that is Sydney Sweeneys character, a nice, polite, sweet woman who seems to be on this path of enlightenment, trying to find herself. She's introduced to Alvaro Mortes character who leads you to believe into all of his intentions. Both actors play really well into their roles, elegant and moving with the rhythms of the movie quite nicely.Things pick up quickly in this movie, right from the start, you are getting the feeling that something is wrong but not all the answers are so obvious yet. So you go with the story and you are engaged throughout the film. It is a simple story in the best of ways, not complex enough to lose track of what it is really about and I love that.It is an ending you suspect but never really expect. The element of surprise is not strong but you are still watching even though you know what's about to happen, you can't take your eyes off the screen. Sydney's final moments on screen have you entranced, you are rooting for her and you know what needs to be done. By the end she isn't the same person that she started out as, that is clear.I wouldn't necessarily watch this movie very often but it still does have some rewatch value, it's worth it to see in cinemas.Good scares, grotesque depictions, it makes you uncomfortable from time to time which is right up what you'd expect from a scary movie."," Simplicity Works"
"5","Immaculate","carie-33379","4/10","30 March 2024","Not sure why this is categorized as a horror because it was NOT scarey AT ALL!! Maybe a drama yes, BUT definitely not a horror. You saw more nuns in wet see through clothing than you did anything that would be considered horror. Total waste of my money! I think the context of the movie was good, but it was HORRIBLY put together. It dragged out until the last 20 minutes. Plus, I am pretty sure nuns don't run around without undergarments.The horror parts contained a girl getting her cut off and a couple of faces being smashed in. I also did not like how it ended with her killing an innocent child."," Definitely NOT horror!!!"
"6","Immaculate","ParkJano","6/10","3 April 2024","If Rosemary's Baby, The Nun and Get Out had a baby, it would be this. The first two mentioned, are obvious. But this reminded me of Get Out in several other ways. Them luring the main character to their house, using them for secret motive, and how she started killing them off one by one in the end felt very 3rd act of Get Out.I enjoyed the gore and shocking moments visually. They definitely tried to do something there. It was well shot & surprisingly none of the acting made me cringe or want to KMS like horror movies are bound to have.Not sure why they wasted the beautiful Simona though. Like why cast her in a role that small."," It tried, but wasn't anything special"
"7","Immaculate","draculastomb","1/10","30 March 2024","This is just another over hashed version of Rosemary's Baby. I see people have no problem in doing something like this and thinking its ""cool"" or ""hip"" yet one wonders why they are not doing this to other religions? Are they scared or what? This movie is a perfect example of what happens when you cant come up with original ideas on your own. Save your money its not worth the effort. And you wont be able to get back all the time you wasted in going to watch this. There are far better movies out there to go see and sadly this isnt one of them. This will most likely make its money on bargain bin rentals or red box."," yet another attack on Religion"

"10","Immaculate","Heyitsbennett","4/10","27 March 2024","Let me be clear, I did not see this because I thought it would be good. I saw this because although Sidney Sweeney cannot act, she is very good at emotional acting and the reviews were not terrible. I thought I'd give her a try in a different genre. I give this a 4/10. She proved me correct again, she cannot act, but yeah, her emotional parts and moments of desperation were very good. Messy concept, messy plot, boring execution, but was pretty at points I guess and had the bones. Now I just have to figure out words to meet the character count. So please ignore the rest of my review as it has nothing to do with the movie."," Ugh"
"11","Immaculate","dnkrjybw","9/10","23 March 2024","The story of this movie was pretty interesting and actually was pretty accurate to the catholic religion making the movie feel more authentic to me.It was kinda weird seeing Syndney Sweeney in a horror movie but she did a good job acting
Overall I say watch it and it also had references from the omen in the movie I think not sure tho may be a stretchIt was really ironic too because when I got to the movies my old coworker I was yoga friends with was right next to me with her boyfriend. It was so crazy. I don't miss my old job tho it was unnecessary.Watch the movie tho and see for yourself it's not a stupid demon jumpscare like many other movies (example : the nun~ CGI was absolutely horrible and the story was not interesting what's so ever)"," Has more substance to it other than constant unnecessary jump scares like many other horror movies these days"
"12","Immaculate","josephrusyn","4/10","22 March 2024","This movie felt like a mashup of a dozen other movies with nothing unique to offer. An irrelevant dream sequence, a figure that disappears with the flick of a light switch, some super loud scene cuts for no reason. When the finale finally rolls around it feels a little lacking The lead actress was also an odd choice, her ditsy American demeanor felt jarring.in a period piece. It did offer some good cinematography, some disturbing gore and the plot was at least cohesive. But overall the 60 opening prologue was the best part. Skip it and wait for one of the many promising movies to be released this year."," It was .. fine."
"13","Immaculate","TomTalksFilms","7/10","25 March 2024","Immaculate is a horror that was released in UK cinemas this past weekend and wait for it... it's not an A24 film 😯.It is however a religious cult like film
and stars Sydney Sweeney as the protagonist Sister Cecilia.Cecilia has just had to move from her local church in the US due to low turn out and has seemingly been scouted by a priest who invites her to join his convent in Italy which see accepts. What follows is an atmospheric horror where all is not what it seems.Religious cult horror films are two a penny and on the surface this seems like just another run of the mill title however I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I think what attracts film makers to this specific sub genre of horror is that church's and monastery's etc provide beautiful locations for cinematography.In the day you have the beautiful architecture but at night you have dingy corridors often low lit with candles the likes of which anything could be lurking behind. This film used its supposed Italian monastery location perfectly to build a generally eerie atmosphere and it's this that builds the foundations for what is a surprisingly good time at the cinema.As for the horror itself it's a bit of a mix of jump scares and gory violence. It's not a slasher film whilst at the same time it's not a Conjuring esc jump scare fest either, It gives you a bit of both. A couple of the jump scare scenes actually made me jump a little bit despite me knowing that they were coming. I'm still unsure wether this was the film catching me by surprise or just the sheer burst of volume from the cinema speakers during these scenes but either way I'm not sure it would have had the same effect had I watched this film at home. As for the gore, I think it's been a bit overhyped how gory the film is it's certainly nothing like The Evil Dead or anything close for that matter but there are a couple of bloody scenes of violence for those who like that side of the horror genre.I want to talk about what I felt the film was trying to say about the real world but to do so would require me to go into spoilers. I didn't notice it until the films last shot but it has very subtle feminist themes. On looking on IMDB after the film was actually written and directed by men so good job guys.I also can't talk about this film without saying how good Sydney Sweeney is as the protagonist. It's great to see her in a film where she actually keeps her clothes fully on for pretty much the entire runtime. Don't get me wrong I'm all for women doing what they want with their bodies and hey sex sells but this film shows that she's so much more than well let's just say her assets and leave it at that.Overall what seemed like just another horror warning of the dangers of religion ended up being a throughly enjoyable 90 minutes at the cinema that I highly recommend checking out."," Surprising amount of depth"
"14","Immaculate","theromanempire-1","6/10","3 April 2024","The first hour was a pleasant surprise. Nice dialogue, plot music all worked fine and the omen feeling was strong in the film.The lead actress was captivating and even the supportive cast was nice.The gore was plenty so what went wrong ?Sadly after the first hour the scenario did not made much sense and to present those supposed religious persons doing what they were doing in the lab inside the covenant was a bit extreme and disappointing.They could explain the lead actress' pregnancy a different way.After all they presented her at first like holy mairy who conceived by a miracle like the virgin mary did 2000 years ago. This could work but suddenly we learned her pregnancy was fue to those creepy lab experiments and that was not a satisfactory explanation.Anyhow the ending of the movie was not well done and u got the feeling that the gore was made as a nessessity or something like that.So the first hour was good then it was somehow ruined by the ending so the result was a bit bitter one at the end.So u watch the movie and give your verdict.What's for sure is it was worthy more or less but it sure could have a better ending.The first hour got from me a grade between a B and a B+ but overall the grade is dropped after the last 30 minutes of the film in between a C and a C+."," very good in it's first hour but sadly dropped fast towards the last 30 minutes...."
"15","Immaculate","hollyhhastings","9/10","30 March 2024","A film that is not only entertaining but makes some prescient warnings. This movie is definitely a reflection of today's political climate.Great cinematography and atmosphere. A lot of horror films rely to heavily on overused green or blue gel filters to establish mood. Thankfully this film doesn't do that. Generally great use of lighting.While there are jump scares they're done sparingly and intelligently so it's not used as a crutch for a weak plot.This is my first Sydney Sweeney film and I'll have to see some of her other work. I'm glad here character didn't have a. I liked that her character didn't have a heavy handedly allegorical name. Don't want to call out a character from another movie characters but think Agnus Dei.The score was nicely done as well. The one thing that would've made it perfect was a setting of Ave Verum Corpus."," Gaude virgo gloriosa."
"16","Immaculate","tamera-brar","7/10","23 March 2024","Erm. The end felt like those horrific 18-rated 80's movies where the protaganist is like in full fight for their life mode and they're just screaaaaaaaming. (I mean this positively)Like Sydney, you did smash this role. Fair dues.Slight moments of Rosemary's Baby met The Nun arose there, but did miss the perfect mark overall. But I dig it none the less. The ending was the make or break moment of the movie and it did make it tbf even if they priest did survive a deadly fire that he def shouldn't have...
An enjoyable horror. Predictable but well acted by the protagonist. Horror in a classic form."," Go 'head scream queen"
"17","Immaculate","josellyncc","7/10","25 March 2024","Even 89 minutes is too long for this. First half of the movie could've been shorter. Way too much story in the beginning and not enough in the end. Unnecessary scenes with loose ties. Leaves many things up to interpretation, some purposely but *spoilers* who are the red mask people (or entities)? Sydneys acting is subpar as usual, couldn't buy the nun image. Though end scene was intense and kind of captivating. Everybody who is saying the screaming was too much has never been in a room during natural labor (or labor in general). Of course it is not a Sydney Sweeney movie without boob shots -.-. Don't watch if you have a weak stomach."," sister Sweeney is too paradoxical"
"18","Immaculate","kellytang-50381","5/10","22 March 2024","Not sure what this film is trying to say. I thought before that it was a psychological fear similar to Black Narcissus, but then I realised that it didn't seem to have that kind of depth.That's okay, nun slashers films is also good. Rated 18 I was kinda looking forward to this, thinking it was going to be a bloodbath(like Ready or not). It turned out to be just the story of a nun who gets tricked into getting pregnant and then she runs away. Whole film only three people are killed, and a lot of the gore scenes are practically useless, with neither the kind of scaring the audience nor the implied social depth.The heroine was very physical as a pregnant woman, the ending was not good enough for me. If I were to write it, would have the priest die in the lab, then the heroine gives birth to the monster and tosses it aside, goes back and kills the convent's others, saving the young nun who gets her tongue cut out for telling the truth , and then finally the convent burns down in a fire, and she and the young nun walk off into the night with each other holding on. (If you want a sequel it's even easier, the monster that was left isn't dead, it's hell incarnate)It's certainly going to be corny the way I've arranged it, but it definitely looks better than this."," The story has a rushed ending."
"19","Immaculate","rmattox1","9/10","24 March 2024","This is one of the most interesting religious horrors I've seen. Gory and brutal, Immaculate does not hold back. While there were a few jump scares that you could definitely see or feel coming, the true horror is the situation Sister Cecelia found herself in. At times, Immaculate echoed another excellent horror film, Ready or Not. Sydney Sweeney gives a solid performance here, but I also want to shout out the two actresses that played Sister Isabelle and Sister Gwen. They injected some unexpected humor into the first part of the movie and also gave good performances. Sister Cecelia's final act of defiance and anger was shocking and really sealed in the 9 star rating for me. I highly recommend seeing this movie if you are a fan of pregnancy horror or religious horror. I can see why Sydney Sweeney worked so hard to get this movie made. It was worth it."," A religious horror that doesn't hold back."
"20","Immaculate","davegk-60171","3/10","26 March 2024","This film starts well but disintegrates into a complete hotchpotch of sheer nastiness and plot ridiculousness.The acting from Sydney Sweeney is good and holds the film together somewhat but some of those around her are just poor.The main plot is beyond ludicrous and doesn't stack up at all. Why are there nuns with red faces, how on earth did she get pregnant? Why can she speak Italian sometimes and not others. Why the branding and torture - none of it made the plan more likely to succeed.I just found this torturous and nasty to watch. The violence wasn't earned and the dream jump scares served zero purpose.I think this was aiming for a ""St Maud"" level of horror sophistication - sadly it was more like ""Carry On Evil"" ."," Nasty and Not in a Good Way"
"21","Immaculate","jamesharley81","3/10","21 March 2024","Avoid this film, it's really really bad.Acting, cinematography and costumes were at at good level but the story really let the film down.The film starts with some promise, building a back story, setting some intrigue to the nunery, it takes about 50-60 for the action to really get going and it and finishes after just 80 minutes. It wasn't scary, there was quite a lot of graphic gore which wasn't needed. Stayed to end but I was shaking my head with how daft and ridiculous the story got, loads of holes in the plot and things not explained.

It seems it was created to show Sydney Sweeney (that by the way, her acting is terrible and, is totally diminished by Benedetta Pocaroli).This movie is a bad mix of several good topics, but never consolidate into something serious. It could have been a good topic for a movie, if it would have been better exploited, but unfortunately it was lost in none sense, and please, the ending, forget about super heroes with super powers, this break any human conception of will power (absurd). Also, there are a lot of graphic violence not justified, maybe just to add some interest to the horror lovers (this does not have any real horror elements)."," I waste of time, money and intellect"
"23","Immaculate","alexadumitrescu","4/10","23 March 2024","I had such high expectations of this movie-but that one is on me. Hollywood has recently known this trend of making easy to digest no mystery movies. But in a ""scary"" movie, you would expect to at least find out the plot as late as possible. We find mid-movie what the ideea was all about, very well explained and dumbed down for everyone. In the end, the majestic, so unsurprising end (not really) she kills the said creature-whom we never see anyways. The cast could have done better, even sweeney, who apart from being a really good screamer, is not remarkable in any way.

"24","Immaculate","puredarkstar","7/10","22 March 2024","Yes it's a pregnancy/body horror movie, not remotely supernatural or religious, well I guess a tad religious. I actually liked Sweeny in this movie, it's a slow burn but gets into gore swing in the final act. I'm not buying how they got the DNA however, that kinda fell flat and almost threw the movie off for me personally. I think I was hyping for an antichrist baby so I will have to wait for the new omen movie coming out soonish. The overall feel was cult like, isolating, made me think if I was pregnant with an unknown what would I actually do? This movie was like if Rosemary turned in a raging mother and chopped up the building Satan worshipping inhabitants. Nice to see an unusual turn of events regarding a pregnant victim of a cult movie. No screaming/fainting ninnies in this nunnery."," Pregnant horror"
"25","Immaculate","Vlad_Imirivan",NA,"27 March 2024","A large part of the inspiration for, and popularity of, a certain subgenre of the Gothic novel dealing with unseemly church life can be traced to the ever-reliable anti-Catholic prejudices of the British public from the Reformation onward. Such page turners depict hidden ecclesiastical corruption and other dark secrets with gusto.A similar sense of blinkered rejection and smug relief may be detected in ""Immaculate"" (Neon), a vile piece of horror tripe from director Michael Mohan. In this case, however, the viewpoint is entirely secular rather than Protestant while the animus is more broadly anti-Christian.Since stupidity vies with bigotry for predominance as the proceedings unfold - and since the crackpots who populate the screen bear no resemblance whatsoever to real-life Catholics, beyond the priestly and religious garb they wear - it's tempting to dismiss the whole production out of hand. The presence of a pro-abortion subtext, however, demands attention.Sydney Sweeney plays Sister Cecilia, an American novice in a sinister Italian convent. How did she end up there? Well, her home parish closed for lack of attendance and, rather than simply go to the next church over, she felt the need to cross the Atlantic to find a new spiritual home. This is typical of the reasoning on display in Andrew Lobel's nonsensical script.Sister Cecilia, we're informed, is a vulnerable individual, having had a near-death drowning experience in childhood. So was it really by accident that Father Sal , the nunnery's shady chaplain, reached out to her across the billowy waves? The question, of course, answers itself.As the title hints, Lobel and his collaborators perpetuate the widespread confusion that feeds into their implicit thesis that the church hates sex and wants to control womens' bodies.Mohan, on the other hand, doesn't mind sex at all and clearly doesn't think his viewers do either. Thus we're treated to a scene in which skimpily clad young nuns cavort in a communal bathtub as well as another in which a nude Sister Cecilia, seen in profile, gets an uncomfortable scrub down in the shower after making a break for it.Thinking that explains What's Really Going On. Suffice it to say that, in Father Sal's humble opinion, God's first attempt at redeeming the human race didn't take, so we need Baby Jesus redux.Well, no, as a matter of fact, we don't. Nor do we need ""Immaculate.""The film contains blasphemy, sacrilegious jokes, gory violence, including torture and infanticide, grisly images, partial upper female nudity, sexual humor, at least one use of profanity, a couple of milder oaths and fleeting rough, crude and crass language."," Utter rubbish"
"26","Immaculate","jtindahouse","6/10","20 March 2024","I have a lot of mixed feelings about 'Immaculate'. It did some stuff I really liked, but then let itself down in other areas. It kept the jump-scares to a minimum, but the ones it did have were pretty easy to spot and ineffectual. It had a lot of gory and hard to watch scenes which were pretty effective and probably when the film was at its strongest. It also contained a fake-out dream sequence which is my most hated horror trope. For everything this film did well it seemed to do something else to offset it.At first I had trouble buying Sydney Sweeney as a nun. I just couldn't make it work in my head. What I realised as the film went on however, was that her charisma and natural likeability was what was carrying the film. The absolute fundamental key to any horror movie working is that we have to care about the fate of the character/s. And because of her I did.I liked this film a lot more than I thought I was going after about 15 minutes of the runtime. It's certainly a film that gets better as it goes along. It also does well to not outstay its welcome and keep the runtime to a brisk 89 minutes. I couldn't say this is must-see horror, but I could say it's worthy of giving a chance. 6/10."," A surprisingly gory outing which isn't perfect but finds a way to stay afloat"
"27","Immaculate","BA_Harrison","7/10","17 March 2024","For much of its runtime, Immaculate, starring Sydney Sweeney, treads very familiar religious horror ground, as young nun Sister Cecilia arrives at an Italian convent to take her vows only to find that something about the place isn't quite right. The pace of the film is very deliberate, director Michael Mohan gradually building the creepy atmosphere and delivering the expected jump scares, but it's nothing that we haven't seen before.However, the pace picks up considerably once it is revealed that Cecilia has somehow fallen pregnant, despite not having had congress with a man, and that her superiors will stop at nothing to ensure that she stays at the convent to see the pregnancy through to full term; the remainder of the film is the opposite side of the coin to Satanic classic Rosemary's Baby and it is a lot of fun. The level of violence increases as the film approaches its tense climax, several acts of extreme nastiness definitely deserving of the 18 rating.Immaculate ends with a final act of defiance from Cecilia that is both shocking and thought provoking, ensuring that viewers will be thinking about the movie long after they have left the cinema."," Cecilia's Baby."
"28","Immaculate","jboothmillard","6/10","2 April 2024","The title of this scary movie refers to the term ""immaculate conception"", the belief that God preserved the Virgin Mary of original sin when she was conceived. Mark Kermode gave it a positive review including about it going over the top and the ending being unforgettable, so I was definitely up for that. Basically, during the night at a convent in Italy, Sister Mary (Simona Tabasco) sneaks into the bedroom of a superior and steals a bunch of keys from a drawer to escape. She reaches the locked gates of the convent but is captured and knocked unconscious by three hooded figures. She later wakes up in a coffin and is buried alive. Sister Cecilia (Sydney Sweeney, also producing) has received an invitation from Father Sal Tedeschi (Álvaro Morte) to join an exclusive convent in Italy that looks after dying nuns in their last days. Mother Superior (Dora Romano) instructs Sister Isabelle (Giulia Heathfield Di Renzi) to show Cecilia around. Isabelle acts very cold towards Cecilia, who is disturbed by many of the patients. In a private conversation with Father Tedeschi, Cecilia explains that she turned to religion at a young age after nearly drowning in a frozen lake. She was declared medically dead for seven minutes, she was convinced that God saved her for a purpose. Cecilia befriends Sister Gwen (Benedetta Porcaroli), and they often do chores together, including washing and drying clothes. She is also tasked with killing a chicken by chopping its head off, but she refuses. Cecilia attends several church services presided by Cardinal Franco Merola (Giorgio Colangeli), along with the dozens of other nun staff members, and Tedeschi sits beside her to translate the Italian language, which has not fully learned. During her time at the convent, Cecilia is disturbed by certain oddities, including an elderly nun having scars on her feet in the shape of a crucifix. She later sees a nail said to have been taken from the cross on which Jesus was crucified. One day, after being sick and taken to resident Doctor Gallo (Giampiero Judica), Cecilia is shocked to learn that she is pregnant. Tedeschi and the doctor question her about having intercourse, but she insists she has never broken her vows to God, that she is a virgin and has never had relations with a man. Several staff members begin to treat her as the next Virgin Mary, with many proclaiming the child is a ""blessing"". But some treat her with contempt believing that she has committed sin. One night, while she is in the bath, Sister Isabelle tries to drown Cecilia, jealous of the ""miracle"", shouting that it ""should have been her."" During the first trimester, Cecilia experiences bad health, and is shocked to find one of her teeth has fallen out whilst vomiting. She requests to be taken to a hospital and seen by a proper doctor, but Tedeschi will not allow it, saying that hospitals are filled with harmful diseases. One day, while Cecilia is walking through the cloister, Isabelle is seen falling to her death, but it is unclear if she jumped or was pushed; she also notices strange figures wearing red masks and cloaks, during this time, and other moments around the convent. Gwen publicly chastises the convent superiors for turning a blind eye to the death; she is last seen taken away by Father Tedeschi and Deacon Enzo (Giuseppe Lo Piccolo). During the night, concerned for her safety, Cecilia enters the main office and breaks open a drawer containing all the files. Finding her file, she is shocked to find information on the accident in her childhood. She then hears screaming coming from outside and ventures further to find the female voice. Peaking through a wooden door, Cecilia sees Gwen restrained against a wall by a hooded figure, and she is horrified as she witnesses her friend having her tongue cut out. Cecilia steps back in terror and the elderly Sister Francesca (Betty Pedrazzi) appears and silences her. She begs to escape but Francesca chastises her, saying no one ever leaves. During the second trimester, Cecilia is found heavily bleeding and crying for help, and Tedeschi is forced to take her to hospital. Mother Superior sobs that the child may have been lost, but then she finds a dead chicken beheaded beneath Cecilia's bed. She realises Cecilia has faked a miscarriage in an attempt to escape the convent. During the car journey, Cecilia realises she has been rumbled following a phone call, she tries to run before being forcibly brought back by Tedeschi and Enzo. While Cecilia is tied up, Tedeschi reveals that before becoming a priest he was a geneticist and carried out biological experiments. He has been experimenting with DNA samples taken from the crucifixion nail, wanting to resurrect Christ and bring the Second Coming, but it is only twenty years later he has had his success with Cecilia. Cecilia is branded with heated crosses to burn the crucifix onto her feet, a symbol she had seen on many of the other nuns; this also makes it more difficult to walk and attempt another escape. By the third trimester, Cecilia is heavily pregnant and due any day now. She is horrified that the child could save the world or end it as written in the Bible in Revelation. When the opportunity presents itself, Cecilia makes another attempt to escape. She hits Mother Superior over the head with a crucifix and beats her to death. Shortly after, she curses as her water breaks. Next, she strangles the cardinal to death using her rosary (a string of knots or beads). Finally, she hobbles to Tedeschi's laboratory, which contains several failed attempts to create a baby, including deformed infant samples, using the DNA from the nail. She finds a canister of ethanol and douses the underground chamber of demented experiments. Tedeschi arrives and tries to stop her through physical force, but Cecilia narrowly escapes, drops a lighter inside and ignites the ethanol, with the priest trapped inside. Cecilia stands back and gleefully watches Tedeschi presumably burning to death inside, but she is stunned as he has found an extinguisher to put out the flames. She is forced to flee into the catacombs of the convent with Tedeschi in pursuit. She travels through many unending tunnels until she reaches a chamber and hides as Tedeschi calls after her. In this chamber, she is frightened to find Gwen's mutilated corpse, then she walks out to continue looking for a way out. Eventually, Cecilia reaches a hole in the walls of the catacombs. She tries to escape before Tedeschi arrives, with severe facial burns. Pinning her down, Tedeschi attempts to perform an improvised caesarean section, cutting her stomach open to get the baby. But Cecilia manages to stab Tedeschi in the throat with the crucifixion nail, which she had previously stolen, killing him instantly. Cecilia exits the catacombs, finding herself outside some ruins on a countryside hillside. A blood-covered Cecilia screams in both painful agony and trauma of her experiences as she gives birth to the child. After delivering her baby, she bites through the umbilical cord herself. It remains in close-up on her face as she looks down in horror at the sight of the baby, which does not cry, only making unnerving gurgling grunting sounds. She walks away to a nearby crumbling wall and grabs a nearby rock, walking back to the baby and lifting it high above her head, and screaming as she smashes it downwards, and it cuts to black after she has presumably crushed the unseen child to death. Also starring Cristina Chinaglia as Sister Friede, Niccolò Senni as Customs Official, Isabel Desantis as Young Cecilia, Viviane Florentine Nicolai as Sister Sally, and Marisa Regina as Sister Joan. Sydney gives a fantastic leading performance as the devout young woman who becomes pregnant without having sex, it took a long time for her to bring this film to life, which she auditioned for ten years ago(!), Morte is well cast as the priest you slowly realise is a mad scientist with nasty intentions, and there is good support from Romano and others. It should be mentioned that there were two single takes filmed for the powerful ending, it was the first take used, which is all in Sweeney's performance/face, and you must imagine what you don't see, we don't if the child is human or hideous, which makes it all the more memorable. It is the usual kind of setup, an innocent victim going to somewhere seemingly idyllic and slowly uncovering its dark secrets, and an unwanted pregnancy that becomes like something from Rosemary's Baby, and it is suitably chilling and atmospheric, a creepy nun movie that works, a most worthwhile psychological horror. Good!"," Immaculate"
"29","Immaculate","kevin_robbins","6/10","22 March 2024","My wife and I watched Immaculate (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline follows an American nun who arrives at her new calling in Italy. Shortly after her arrival, a strange ritual takes place, and she wakes up pregnant despite never having had sex. As her new church helps her cope with the circumstances, it becomes evident that something is amiss.Directed by Michael Mohan (The Voyeurs) and starring Sydney Sweeney (Euphoria), Álvaro Morte (Money Heist), Benedetta Porcaroli (Amanda), Simona Tabasco (The White Lotus), and Betty Pedrazzi (The Hand of God).This is one of those uneven movies with numerous elements you like and a few eye rolling ones too. The acting, circumstances, and horror elements are commendable, with Sydney Sweeney delivering an outstanding performance, particularly in one of the best birthing scenes in horror history. The kills, blood splatter, and gore are executed with precision, and the attention-grabbing corpses add to the film's intensity. However, the effectiveness of the red cloth masks falls short of expectations, and Álvaro Morte's performance feels somewhat lacking in authenticity, causing frustration at times. There is a bathing scene that's one of the highlights of the film, but even that could have been executed better. Despite these shortcomings, standout scenes like the punishment sequence and the outstanding use of a cross adds worthwhile elements for horror enthusiasts.In conclusion, Immaculate offers enough redeeming qualities to warrant a viewing, although it falls short of achieving greatness. I would rate it a 6/10 and recommend it for fans of the genre."," Immaculate offers enough redeeming qualities to warrant a viewing, although it falls short of achieving greatness."
"30","Immaculate","Ltufano23","8/10","15 March 2024","I recently had the pleasure of attending the NEON/Letterboxd sneak screening of Immaculate at New York's famous Metrograph cinema. Produced by and starring blossoming Hollywood star Sydney Sweeney, the film had been a passion project of hers after auditioning for the role in 2014. Though it fell through at the time, Sweeney recently acquired the project and became the film's producer. After revising the script, she chose Michael Mohan as the director due to their experience working together on previous projects such as The Voyeurs and Everything Sucks. Partnering with independent film distributor NEON, Immaculate quickly came to an exciting fruition.After a near death experience in her childhood, Cecilia (Sydney Sweeney) vows to devote herself to the lord as she begins her new life as a nun. The only American in an Italian convent, Cecilia finds herself as an outsider from most of her peers. Suffering a nightmarish encounter, she unexpectedly learns that she is pregnant with an immaculate conception. As her pregnancy progresses and the convent begin worshipping her, she becomes overwhelmed by the feeling of uncertainty. Digging deeper, unsettling discoveries lead Cecilia to question her unlikely situation and fear for what may come next.Immaculate brings a refreshing style to the modern horror genre. Steadily burning and becoming increasingly uncomfortable, the film creates an unsteady aura that lands viewers on the edge of their seats. Set and filmed in the Italian countryside, the hyper-religious focus makes for an eerie environment when mysterious encounters begin. Though there are a few moments which go a bit over the top, the outlandish nature of the entire situation allows those aspects to fit decently into the pilgrimage. Coming in at 1 ½ hours, the short runtime races by as every moment is packed with continually captivating developments that keep viewers immersed in the roller coaster of events. The haunting journey culminates in a heart-pounding final act, which does not subside until the credits begin roll.Taking on the lead role alongside her first time producing, Sydney Sweeney is remarkably captivating as she traverses through her uncharted territory. She is chillingly convincing in her role and seamlessly switches from charming to traumatized with exceptional facial emoting. After being one of the best parts in the disastrous Madame Web, Sweeney is certainly expunged of that sin with this devout performance. Immaculate is one of Sweeney's most memorable and well-executed roles, hopefully paving the way for her to continue producing projects that she is passionate about.Immaculate succeeds in crafting a surreal psychological experience. Sydney Sweeney produces an intriguing story and elevates the journey further with her truly harrowing performance. Horror buffs and casual fans alike will rejoice as the genre is gifted a film which should undoubtably be discussed alongside similar distinguished thrillers such as Eraserhead or Mother. Passionately conceived, Immaculate is a hopeful beacon for original ideas in Hollywood and leaves the future bright for the next step in Sweeney's prosperous career."," Immaculate Delivers a Truly Unsettling Horror Experience"

There's no Megan-type winks to the audience, instead it's decidedly Barbarian in style. Also, it's more of an Italian film than anything else, with at least half the dialogue and nearly all of the production crew being Italian - which I see as a good thing.The cinematography was excellent as was music and sound, but what really made it work and hang together was a top draw performance from Ms Sweeney.

Of course, old Italian convents are creepy, people are suspicious, and bad dreams suggest worrying stuff is on the way. But when that includes pregnancy despite any, you know, dot dot dot, what will people at the convent think?This horror movie threatened to go in one direction but went in another, which I quite liked: the early surprise scares proved to be a bit of misdirection. I liked the story.For most of the film's length, I wondered at the 18 certificate but, by the very end, I got it. The film was very atmospheric, aided by the location. And Cecilia?This is the third Sydney Sweeney film I've seen in fairly quick succession. I went into the first thing thinking she was a pretty girl capitalising on her boobs. After a romcom, superhero movie, and horror, two of which are self-produced, tell me I was wrong. She's a good actress and has real screen presence. She anchors this film."," Well done Sydney"

Some of the characters creep you out right from the start and get progressively worse as the movie goes on. It was gory, it had a few really good jump-scares, and even the plot was interesting. Going into it I thought it was a possession type movie, but it definitely was not. Very creepy though. It gets pretty intense and graphic towards the end so if you are squeamish, be warned. If a teenager forgetting to eat his movie candy because he's so into the film isn't a seal of approval, I don't know what is.

"34","Immaculate","Bloomer","9/10","21 March 2024","I went along to Immaculate hoping or expecting perhaps Blumhouse levels of variable quality. What I got was one of those wonderful surprise horror film experiences where you can barely believe the extremity of what you're experiencing. That such an experience can still be had in your local suburban cinema in 2024 is, paradoxically, a great comfort.Immaculate is a surprisingly brutal horror film, with a vein of black humour, about an immaculate conception in a retirement-focused nunnery(!). The direction is measured, suspense-building, sometimes poetic (the enormous tear expelled from the heroine's eye as she watches torture through a keyhole). The production design and texture, and the uncomfortable music, are wonderful. There's a folk horror kind of paranoia at work, and also little ghosts of Suspiria about the place, especially in the section where Sweeney's cynical friend gets on the wrong side of the people running the nunnery.Before the finale, the brutality comes in small dose, meaning the film retains the power to shock. Sweeney must travel in her performance from a not atypical wide-eyed novitiate to a woman completely brutalised and out of her mind. She succeeds, and I can anticipate the last long shot of Immaculate finding its way into 'classic horror scenes' canon.The film almost feels a little short, but I think - why muck around? I hope Immaculate does really well today, as it is certainly not mucking around. Either way, I can tell that in horror circles, this film will stand in the long term."," Surprisingly brutal religious horror film that isn't fooling around"

Anyone but You, Madame Web, and now this) plays Cecilia, a devout American girl who enters an Italian convent. From the start, it's plain that there's something creepy about the place. Admittedly, a cardinal only needs to put on cope and mitre to seem creepy, but there's clearly more to things that that. Some of those Cecilia meets there seem a little too friendly, others are downright hostile.Strange and disturbing things happen, including a death. Then it's discovered that Cecilia is pregnant. The powers that be announce that this is The Immaculate Conception: the Sequel. They seem to be convinced of this rather too easily, but then we find out why.In the last act, matters resolve themselves violently and nastily. I felt that credulity was stretched much too far here; Cecilia seems capable of an awful lot of physical activity for a woman in labour, for example.Sweeney radiates a convincing aura of naive innocence (though it's probably time for her to stop playing teenagers) and the rest of the cast pull off the difficult feat of radiating nastiness without over-acting.Short and anything but sweet."," If you liked St Maud, you'll like this"
"36","Immaculate","cutie7","5/10","20 March 2024","I had the chance to catch ""Immaculate"" before its release, hoping for a fresh horror experience set in a stunning Italian convent. Unfortunately, the movie felt like a letdown. The story follows Cecilia, who's supposed to uncover some dark secrets in her new, holy home, but it all ends up feeling too familiar.The film tries to be edgy and dark but doesn't quite hit the mark, almost playing it safe like a PG-13 movie so any comparisons to ""Saint Maud"" almost feel like an insult. It teases us with brutality but pulls its punches, leaving us with a sense of ""been there, seen that"" rather than genuine chills or thrills.Despite its beautiful setting and a premise that could have taken us on a deep, disturbing dive into faith and fear, ""Immaculate"" doesn't deliver. It ends up feeling like a collection of horror clichés without the bite, missing a chance to really stand out. For those looking for a horror movie that packs a punch, this might not be it."," A Missed Opportunity"
"37","Immaculate","statuskuo","3/10","25 March 2024","I do not get the appeal of Sydney Sweeney. Perhaps in this case playing a nun and taking the focus off her chest and onto her face spotlighted the flaw in which Syd exists in. Which is an oblong blank face.Can we stop pretending she is anything but chest? Or are we still in this odd phase where she is the ""new look"" Hollywood will go with.Okay, so she's a nun here. And the powers that be leave no time in pointing out her attractive face. The Italian Customs agents, to be precise. Why? Who knows. Perhaps it's to give her the sense of leering foreboding. Works better if her character understood Italian.She's an American who has elected to be a nun at this creepy Italian place (sound familiar? ""Suspiria"", duh). Shortly after encountering weird bumps in the night, she is informed she's pregnant! Oh...and by Immaculate Conception. Get it? The title.

But it's shot so somberly, it's hard to fall under the category of ""so bad, it's good"" Ari Aster has nothing to worry about.The ending leaves a lot to be desired.

Acting generally good, location/costumes etc good.I also liked the general premise and thought it had a huge amount of potential, that was totally wasted !The film is quite short, so you don't need to endure it for too long.What was not good and down right badFrom the start the it was filmed in a sort of dark drab, even if it was sunny it was dark. Presumably the makers thought this would set a 'dark tone'. In fact it was just irritating to watch, imagine going to the cinema and finding you only had your prescription sunglasses. Visuals should be used to enhance a story, not instead of. This is lazy story telling.Absurdities. E.g. The location is sort of a hospice for elderly nuns. It has modern medical equipment and electricity. For some reason everyone walks around with candles in the dark, there are lit candles about - particularly absurd when you have people with dementia. Lazy story telling to have people wandering about in shadows for those 'jump' scares.The big 'inquisition' as to had she ever had sex. Meaningless, as we discover the inquisitors know all, so pointless scene.Gore and horror that really had no great meaning, didn't add to the sory or put you 'in the story' . Just blood a guts for the sake of it.Would I watch this again ? Definitely not, 3/10 tripe.Very dissappointed and was glad when the film ended (which it did abruptly)"," Not immaculate, but a very flawed story"

The concept does go to waste when there is not much to the movie as Cecilla is trying to escape.The film does lack scares. Not one bit of horror. It does play more of a psychological thriller.

"42","Immaculate","steveinadelaide","7/10","21 March 2024","Sydney Sweeney sheds her good-girl persona in Immaculate, a horror film that throws a devout young nun, Cecilia, headfirst into the nightmarish underbelly of a secluded Italian convent. While the premise is deliciously creepy, the execution lands somewhere between a campy throwback and a missed opportunity for deeper thematic exploration.There's no denying the film's fun factor. The first act lures you in with idyllic Italian countryside visuals and a warm welcome for Cecilia. But the cracks soon begin to show, and the movie gleefully dives into increasingly bizarre and bloody territory. Think The Wicker Man meets Suspiria with a dash of Sweeney's signature intensity. The special effects, while not top-of-the-line, lean into a practical, grotesque quality that complements the film's grindhouse vibe.Sweeney is the undeniable star here. She beautifully portrays Cecilia's transformation from wide-eyed innocent to a woman fighting for survival, both physically and emotionally. There's a vulnerability in her performance that makes you root for her, even as she descends into badassery. The supporting cast, however, feels a bit one-note. Their portrayals of the enigmatic nuns are more stereotypical than chilling.The historical and cultural context of Catholicism is undeniably present, with religious iconography and rituals fueling the film's atmosphere. However, Immaculate doesn't quite commit to a deeper social commentary on faith or female subjugation. It throws out intriguing themes but doesn't fully explore them, leaving me wanting more.The score is a haunting blend of choral music and discordant strings, perfectly capturing the unsettling duality of the convent. The editing is sharp, keeping the pace brisk and the scares coming. There's a sense of stylish chaos to the film, particularly in the later acts, that's undeniably entertaining.Immaculate isn't immaculate. The script could have benefited from tighter plotting and a clearer thematic focus. But for fans of campy horror with a strong leading performance, it delivers a wild ride. So, if you're looking for something to shock you and maybe make you laugh a little (nervously), then step into the convent with Cecilia. Just don't expect a profound spiritual experience."," A holy terror with room for improvement"

While they heavily relied on cheap jump scares and gore for their shock factor and spook, it still retained quite a good atmosphere, with solid pacing and interesting action.My biggest gripe with this is the amount of times we have seen this storyline or something similar without really adding anything wildly new or original to it. Offhand I can think of at least five movies that are extremely similar in plot and vibe to this movie that are just as good if not better. Which begs the question, what was the point and why would I watch this one over any of the others.I don't think that this lack of originality has to fully negate what successes were in this movie, but it definitely dims them. I also wasn't wowed by the acting. I thought the performance by the lead girl, while not awful, was a tad underwhelming.It is still certainly worth a watch. It was engaging, unsettling and scary at times. However, if you are well acquainted with the genre, you're not going to be seeing much you haven't seen before. 5.5 rounding up to a 6, would recommend."," Mehaculate"

Horror is a great genre to tell stories rich in subtext, which is all brought to the surface here as Cecila fights for control of her own body.Sydney Sweeney is phenomenal, the whole film is held together by her performance. She's the reason you're so invested which then makes everything even more tense and it all culminates in an extended sequence which requires so much in one go and she does it all.Before it goes crazy at the end, Michael Mohan's direction relies on the uneasy suspense, precise framing and a few effective jump scares to balance out the ones that rely too much on loud noises.

The prologue prepares us for what is to come; a none too pleased young sister tries to flee from the convent but is captured by three hooded figures, she awakens in a coffin, buried alive! Sister Cecilia (Sydney Sweeney) comes from the US to join the convent, she swiftly gets on the wrong side of Sister Isabella a senior nun who seems to be simmering with rage and jealous of Cecilia, but makes friends with another young postulant who gives off a bad girl vibe, sister Gwen. Cecilia and Gwen along with other young women make their initial vows before a Cardinal who seems to be based in the Convent. Things start to go pear shaped, Cecilia has strange dreams/visions, she encounters a nun wearing a red mask. She is called before the Cardinal and a doctor who informs her that she is pregnant. She convinces them that she has not broken her vows and they proclaim that the pregnancy is an Immaculate Conception. It is difficult to say more about how the narrative unfolds without introducing spoilers but the film does head off in an unexpected direction. Suffice to say that this is a grim, dark film with gory scenes of violence. A heavy crucifix is used to bash someone's head in, a rosary serves as a garrote, a nun comes crashing down from a height and we even get a chase through catacombs. Some really crazy clerics about but there are also ethereal scenes, the nuns dress Cecilia in a blue robe and she looks just like a BVM statue, nuns moving through sheets pegged out on lines.

Since it's a horror movie, you can assume that something is going to be off putting about the place to Cecilia. It's easy to predict most scenes and outcomes of situations.No real original scenes or inspiring plot.Now the movie it's self, despite being a bit flawed, did really well. I'm honestly impressed with it. With having some unoriginal moments and scares, they took those and made it good. The eerie and creepy setting really made me feel like I was there with Cecilia in a flight mode. The major plot and turnaround worked super well! I personally enjoyed it.

"50","Immaculate","JohnDeSando",NA,"29 March 2024","""Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?"" Shakespeare's Hamlet to Ophelia.Immaculate is one of the horror films not horrible in the generic sense that uses multiple tropes like jump scares and mis-directions to scare the bejesus out of the audience. It is rather a well-thought-out dissection of the forces with which a normal young woman must contend as she prepares to take her vows to become a nun.It is also a rather somber treatise on the hopes and dreams of a faith community investing in one figure outsized enough to achieve quasi sainthood in her lifetime. Cecilia (a remarkable Sydney Sweeney, reminding us of Anna Taylor-Joy with uber-expressive eyes) travels to picturesque Italy to become a nun in a famous convent.Sweeney plays her as an innocent who eventually becomes the hopes of a major enclave of nuns veritably waiting for the re-emergence of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in this case the virginal Cecilia. They are certain it is Cecilia because she becomes with child, and, well, she's damned comely and innocent.Although Immaculate has its share of wicked ladies, some of whom will get a share of the requisite horror-trope blood, the real evil belongs with the males, a cardinal (Giorgio Colangeli) and resident priest (Alvaro Morte), for instance, whose paternalism would turn Christ over more than once were He to have a grave.Throughout, director Michael Mohan and writer Andrew Lobel have kept a sure hand showing the large assemblage of devout ladies strongly ruled by a small contingent of men who couldn't possibly understand the struggles of women who have cloistered themselves from the normal joys and sorrows of those who embrace love and desire in a normal world.Part of the visual success comes from cinematographer Elisha Christian's grey-dark lens, which invests the glorious Italian country side and majestic estate with gloom. Helping immensely the demonic feel is Will Bates's score, somber and ethereal at the same time.Immaculate is a classic religious scare like The Exorcist but with less spectacle and more thematic heft. It uncovers the demands religion makes on the most devout while it successfully reminds me of my awe and fear of the black and white authority figures that ruled my primary schoolscape.When Sister Alexia stood me up in sixth grade and called me a ""dirty thing"" for holding a girl's hand, it took quite some time for me to realize it wasn't the right call and even longer to see that sex was the demon those penguin dictators couldn't control.See Immaculate because it's one of the year's best entertainments with insights far beyond most horror films. See it as a training film for the nun experience."," Get thee to this nunnery--it's that good."
"51","Dune","Jeremy_Urquhart","8/10","20 July 2023","One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure."," A challenging watch to be sure, but a worthwhile one."
"52","Dune","Orlando_Gardner","8/10","19 July 2023","You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch."," Murphy is exceptional"
"53","Dune","Bonobo13579","2/10","21 July 2023","I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil."," Quality but exhausting"
"54","Dune","MrDHWong","6/10","20 July 2023","""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10."," A brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws"

"56","Dune","Geekofriendly","3/10","26 July 2023","I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb."," Nolan touches greatness, falls slightly short"

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"61","Dune","timmyhollywood","10/10","23 July 2023","Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10."," Breaks all filmmaklng rules, but not in a good way"
"62","Dune","Dvir971","8/10","19 July 2023","Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works.

"63","Dune","EShy","10/10","25 July 2023","I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code.

No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

"65","Dune","TheBigSick","5/10","28 July 2023","0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film."," Overlong and Overcomplicated"
"66","Dune","Zay-Fee","8/10","20 July 2023","Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves."," Exceptional storytelling and Genius Cinametography"
"67","Dune","leestoych","3/10","22 July 2023","At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10."," Technically superb but..."

I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

"73","Dune","tm-sheehan","5/10","20 July 2023","My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet."," Stunning - put it in a time capsule"
"74","Dune","GoatOfNeptune","8/10","22 July 2023","Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"75","Dune","heykateforever","6/10","17 February 2024","I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

Why spend so much on a hollywood blockbuster and focus the plot around the security clearance and idiosyncrasies of one person and retrodding on themes about nuclear weapons that we've heard for decades in countless other films? I've studied WWII for years and feel fairly educated in the manhatten project, and I found the plot found the most boring way possible to portray the period, the project and the people involved.And then there's the...explosion. So much hype about the explosion scene and how CGI wasn't used, and it showed.

Perhaps some viewers knew next to nothing about the race for the atomic bomb or about the appeal of the Communist Party to Western intellectuals in the 1930s or about the dog-eat-dog bureaucracy of secretive ""war""committees in Washington D. C. Or perhaps viewers have never seen a movie by Fellini (""81/2"") or Robert Altman (""Nashville""), or Alain Resnais (""Hiroshima, mon amor"").At the very least, read John Hersey's still relevant ""Hiroshima,"" which I found far more informative and valuable than ""Oppenheimer"" in spite of the IMAX treatment Nolan's film has received (why the IMAX ratio? For the 5-minute scene of an experimental detonation of Oppenheimer's pet project?).I was going to flesh out each of my categories, but I see that numerous reviewers have beat me to it. Anyway, how does one review acting when the script is so short on characterization and so preoccupied with the bomb that actors are denied the opportunity to deepen their roles? The scene with Oppenheimer meeting Truman was so brief, rushed and shallow that, for me, it represented the same deficiencies of this entire overrated project--a ""glorified documentary."".Perhaps worst of all, the Oscar noise about this film has given audiences an excuse not to take seriously the film about the virtuoso musician viewed by many as the most important musical artist in American history. Does anyone realize, or even care, that for the brief but powerful scene in which he conducts Mahler's grandiose, epic Second Symphony, Bradley Cooper had worked for 2 years to capture the distinctive conducting style of Bernstein?If any movie was worthy of the IMAX-treatment--for visual impact as well as awesome sound--that scene alone was more radioactive than Nolan's disappointing 3-hour film about America's first big WMD.

Was this what we hoped to get?We had seen some excellent acting, fine photography and a sometimes gripping story. I learned a bit about American politics.Unfortunately, a mediocre script, chopped up by dreadful editing kept us on our toes the whole time, trying to figure out who was who, what was this persons' relevance and what happened when.There was no subtlety. Once every two minute we were jolted out of our seats by sudden heavy sounds, presumably aimed at waking us up. Yes, they got our attention. Also, some characters were given parts to play that left nothing to be imagined. Strauss, for instance, came across as untrustworthy from the first glance he gave the camera. The president, in his brief encounter with Oppenheimer, was clearly pictured as a man without any doubts or pity,I would call this movie an excellent superficial story. With shortcomings.A bit of a disappointment."," Not worth a second visit"
"91","Dune","abhisheksuresh-56823","4/10","31 July 2023","Yes, it is a very average movie but hyped by the audience. Nolan fans have rated movie very well because they experienced the placebo effect. The movie is nothing special. I must acknowledge that the acting of every actor in the movie is top-notch. What I felt was bad, is the way storyline was presented; nothing creative was tried. Also, the movie is very dialogue intensive. At the end of the movie, I just felt that a lot of facts were poured into my head. Direction is slightly above average. From the perspective of students persuing science in graduation, the movie doesn't have much part of science; they could have showed how great Oppenheimer was in terms of his academic achievements and what all he did, instead, they choose to just say in a one-liner through dialogues!!!"," Very average movie but hyped."
"92","Dune","ZardozConnery","4/10","31 July 2023","Oppenheimer starts switching between past, present and somewhere in between from the get go. As a result the first hour is a chaotic, weird paced struggle to get trough.Then Matt Damon's character gets introduced and the movie starts to become more streamlined and interesting. Too bad it returns to the boring, weird paced style in the last hour.Most of the characters were well acted but i didn't feel any investment because of the boring dialogue and story. I wasn't rooting for a single character.Boring dialogue got mixed with tense music which just felt off. Overal quite boring and a let down."," Just plain boring"

If it would have been Bible or Quran, would they include it in the scene? Never, because their religious sentiments get hurt (Irony!!)Didn't expect this from Chris Nolan. He is my inspiration and hero for his ultimate dramatic and visually baffling movies but his character is degraded to such an extent that he wrote the screenplay for THAT scene in such a manner.Let's fight to remove that intimate scene from the movie all over the world!!!"," Insulting Bhagavad Gita is Everything in this movie's negatives"
"94","Dune","ricsokovi","5/10","22 July 2023","I simply can't like this movie. It wants to say way too much and says way too little about way too many things. It can't decide what it wants to be, so it's not really anything - not just for the viewer, but for the creator. And that's a problem. It's not good as a biopic: there are serious historical flaws in the story, which irritated me. I'm a huge fan of John von Neumann... anyone, who knows who he was understands why I mention him. As a drama? The movie can't decide the centre of the drama. It's too weak as a spy-story, too weak as a political drama, too weak as a personal drama. Not one aspect is worked out to carry the film. The strongest aspect was how many times in american history the ""what you did 20 years ago is more important than who you become and what your expertese is"" ruined people's lives. Or at least was used as a political rethoric against opponents. And I appreciated that, hence the 5 points. As a moral/personal evolution the moral conflict isn't built up, the ""evolution of a scientist"" dies away halfway and doesn't really connect with the ""organizer scientist"". The ""science should or should not have moral boundaries"" isn't worked out and built up, just comes and goes without a purpose. The only detactable personal evolution is the ""man of future becomes the man of past"", but somehow that remains too weak in the end, too. So the movie falls apart and not even the brilliant actors and the massively impressive explosion scene can hold it together.I couldn't help feeling how Nolan this time couldn't feel the fine line of balance... that ""sometimes less is more""."," A disappointment"
"95","Dune","mail-66374","5/10","31 July 2023","Oppenheimer is a long, slow-burning film that is not for everyone. The film is over three hours long, and it can be quite dull at times. However, the soundtrack is excellent, and the film's middle section is particularly well-done.The film tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. The film is well-acted, with Cillian Murphy giving a standout performance as Oppenheimer. However, the film's length and slow pace can be a major drawback.If you are a fan of Christopher Nolan's films, you may enjoy Oppenheimer. However, if you are looking for a more exciting or fast-paced film, you may be disappointed.Here is a more detailed review of the film:Pros:
Excellent acting, especially by Cillian Murphy
Beautiful cinematography
Excellent soundtrack
Thought-provoking themes
Cons:
Too long
Slow pace
Mind-numbingly dull at timesOverall, Oppenheimer is a well-made film with some excellent performances. However, the film's length and slow pace may be a major drawback for some viewers. I would recommend the film to fans of Christopher Nolan's films, but others may want to wait for it to be released on streaming."," 90 minutes too long..."

"100","Dune","felipegunner","5/10","31 July 2023","Christopher Nolan looks more like an indie director making movies in Hollywood. He breaks the traditional recipe of the blockbuster popcorn movie with a plot rather interested in breaking up the story of a WWII character, than in making a story of high intensity and drama, as is the type of Hollywood cinema. I'd say the movie is OKAY, but people and pop culture aren't ready for 3 hours of Oppenheimer getting in trouble for his ""uncertain"" communist party relation, and his bad vibes with his boss.I think it would be better if he had cut it and had kept just the final hour and a half. It would had been perfectly understood.If you havent watched the movie, this might be a great slogan: a Feature Film of a man Struggling with his Colleagues."," A Feature Film of a man Struggling with his Colleagues"
"101","Damsel","yanhhfgs","8/10","11 March 2024","I was really excited to watch this movie. I am a huge show lover, and I love period sci-fi/fantasies. I've seen just about every period drama there is. I was counting the days to watch this.After watching it I was left with so many questions. The plot holes were so large that I wanted more throughout the entire movie. I kept feeling disappointed when it would move on without answers.The ""dragon"" was pitiful.Dragons have been so overdone... so if you are going to make a dragon movie you have to do it right. I loved the suspense and the throwing of the princess into the pit. Only part of the plot I actually enjoyed...I sighed when the dragon began to speak. LOTR cannot be duplicated and Smaug only got away with it because of Peter Jackson's incredible filmmaking.I knew the whole plot as soon as I heard the squelch of the sword during the flashback sequence with the first king. Obviously they owe a debt... ""Targaryen baby dragons"" I thought... I actually went back to prove to my husband they stabbed eggs and what do you know I was right.The claustrophobic scenes with her stuck in the tunnels were intense. Also, I had to fast forward to make it through the burning of the birds. That was way too much. Prolonging innocent death is so classic Netflix.The dragon changed sizes throughout the movie and the game of cat and mouse became boring. It could have been so much better with a little more dimension in the plot. Cut out the opening fluff sequences and cut straight to the throw over the bridge. That's where it got good.Don't watch this if you've seen Game of Thrones.MBB did amazing in Enola Holmes. Go watch that instead.Try again Netflix."," A boring start and a fun ending"
"102","Damsel","stefanies-74423","6/10","18 March 2024","I feel so bad for everyone who worked on this because the cast is stellar, the acting is superb, costumes, CG & VFX, music... are actually not that bad compared to other movies in the same genre. Except the script. Oh boy, the script!I don't know how you manage to turn that mush of overused, cringe ideas into the least innovative, 100% formulaic, boring and predictable heroine trasher imaginable. They could have taken it, ironed out the kings without much effort - because the issues of the stories are already well known - and turned it into something good. Unfortunately, they kept it at copy-pasting the bad and stupid stuff and seasoned it with more cringe.The only thing that kept me from laughing at how bad it was done was the absence of a kissing scene between the princess and the dragon at sunset in the end. And to to be fair: such a kissing scene would have been more memorable and innovative than the rest of the movie.4 Stars, because the movie looks nice and some people really made an effort. It's a good one if you are in vegetable mode on your couch while having a fever, I can't recommend it when looking for a real movie you want to watch while your brain is fully functional."," Good Movie"

There are countless scenes without real depth that quite frankly had be cringing - light on her face, stroking the brides face and telling her to run, and the walk out of the castle with the dragon over head. This cringe, forced English accent and lack of real depth made the movie mediocre for me. Hopefully Millie will bloom into better roles where she doesn't play an English character - I'm sure in years to come she will be one of the best actresses out there playing roles that are more diverse and better suited."," It was ok.

The amount of PR she did for everywhere makes you wonder if they were worried about it from the get go. The CGI in a world of amazing CGI was woeful at best. The storyline was somewhat lacklustre. Do you ever really care about any of the characters? Not even The Damsel really. Dragon was not bad and honestly the end with her and the dragon was probably the best part but it was no GOT level.

I was compelled to ask 'why so much noise? Couldn't she slip through the dungeon quietly?'

Millie is beautiful but I just don't know that this was the right role for her. The biggest downfall of the movie was the lack of emotional depth though. So many scenes that should have brought you to tears were just very bland and almost awkward or obviously forced. However, the biggest positive in my opinion, was the dragon. The dragon was cool looking at least. I probably enjoyed her the most. So there's that. It was cool to watch with my kids at least. The most graphic parts were wounds and blood.

"110","Damsel","nic959","8/10","9 March 2024","In the realm of fantasy and adventure, expectations often soar high, especially when a promising young talent like Millie Bobby Brown is at the forefront. Unfortunately, ""Damsel,"" Netflix's latest foray into the genre, falls significantly short of those expectations, stumbling on several fronts that detract from its potential.First and foremost, Brown's performance in ""Damsel"" is a contentious point. Known for her ability to bring depth and nuance to her roles, Brown seems to miss the mark here, delivering a portrayal that leans towards overacting. While her commitment to the role is evident, the excessive expressiveness detracts from the authenticity of her character, especially in scenes that demand subtlety and restraint.Moreover, the film's attempt to maintain a polished aesthetic for Brown's character, even in the most rugged settings, feels incongruous. Whether she's exploring a dark, damp cave or engaging in a fierce battle with a dragon, her makeup remains immaculate, a choice that undermines the realism and immersion of the narrative. Such details might seem minor, but they accumulate, pulling the audience out of the story and highlighting a lack of attention to context and continuity.The script and writing of ""Damsel"" are other areas where the film falters. The narrative feels underdeveloped, with dialogues and plot progressions that often lack the depth and complexity one would expect from a genre rich in possibilities. This issue is not confined to Brown's character alone; the overall cast delivers performances that range from passable to mediocre, suggesting that the problem lies more with the material they were given rather than their individual talents.While the actors, including Brown, show moments of potential, their efforts are hampered by the film's lackluster script and direction. It's a classic case of a movie that could have been much more, had the writing and character development been given the attention they deserved.In conclusion, ""Damsel"" is a disappointing addition to Netflix's lineup, particularly given the streaming giant's capacity for producing compelling content. While it might offer a few entertaining moments, the film ultimately feels like a missed opportunity to deliver a captivating, coherent fantasy adventure. Viewers might find themselves watching till the end, but more out of a sense of completion than genuine enjoyment."," Couldn't Look Away"

The Dragon raises its arm, ever so slightly, to confirm that the road trip has indeed begun.Exceptional acting, and entertaining - the reason for 5/10.

The movie is well acted, with plenty of star power, but it should have been a multi-year series. So much of it is easily predictable and, ultimately, unsatisfying. The acting, and the casting are not bad, but the use they are put to is deplorable. How can you put Angela Bassett in a film and make it feel like she is so completely wasted?Seriously, I feel that there is so much wasted potential in making this a movie instead of a series. Characters are not nearly developed well enough it could have been so much better if they had all been allowed to grow.

"113","Damsel","gsanta-58580","6/10","28 March 2024","I was intrigued by the film. I love a gender role subversion but this film did not have enough emotional stakes for me. But if it was going shallow action then I don't think it did much better. Most of the film is hiding in, and escaping from, a cave. If the film was going for tension and suspense, then they brough out the monster too soon. I like the idea of sneaking through the cave, but this was not that. This was dodging fire blasts. The last scene was confusing and the lore left me with some pretty basic questions. The penultimate scene was just funny because of the full mascara and cat eye make-up.It's a fast-forward film."," Dark, Sexually Obsessed, Yet Somewhat Interesting"

Everybody knows dragons are immune to fire, certainly their own fire. This is really nothing more than 2024 teen drama and sadly MBB can't save it. Not even Robin Wright can convince me to forgive the shortcuts and just plain laziness of the screenwriting.

"117","Damsel","natetyner-81077","8/10","10 March 2024","This is a film that attempts to weave a tale of a princess being used as a sacrifice to appease the wrath of a dragon, but ultimately falls short in delivering an engaging and innovative storyline. The plot unfolds in a disappointingly predictable manner, with twists and turns that can be seen from a mile away. In fact, the word ""generic"" doesn't even begin to describe the lack of originality in the narrative.Throughout the film, the audience is taken on a journey that feels like a rehash of countless other fantasy adventures. The characters, plot points, and resolutions all feel like recycled elements from mid-level storytelling, leaving little room for surprises or genuine emotional investment.While the film may hold some appeal for a younger audience who may not have been exposed to a wide range of films over the years, it fails to offer anything new or compelling for more seasoned viewers. For those accustomed to the rich tapestry of storytelling found in cinema, ""Damsel"" may come across as little more than background noise - a forgettable addition to the fantasy genre that lacks the spark of creativity needed to truly captivate its audience.In conclusion, ""Damsel"" is a film that struggles to break free from the constraints of its own predictability. While it may find a place among those seeking a simple and straightforward fantasy tale, it ultimately fails to leave a lasting impression or offer anything of substance to those looking for a more engaging cinematic experience."," Weird yes, but good"

I think the weakest part really was the writing. The dialogue in most scenes wasn't very good, and the structure/pacing of the movie didn't keep me interested. Even the ending wasn't very satisfying.Watching this also made me think of ""The Princess"", a movie about a captured damsel who has to fight her way through her captors. That movie had HORRIBLE dialogue, but at least the action was fun. ""Damsel"" has better writing and acting, but less compelling action.Like I said at the beginning, I think if you want a more enjoyable experience from a movie, watch ""Prey""."," Imaginative and beautiful"
"120","Damsel","iamsimonfalcon","7/10","10 March 2024","I had high hopes for this movie, given that it stars, Millie Bobby Brown, well known for her role in stranger things. Overall, as others have commented, it's not terrible but it's not great either. The problem is they really don't leave anything up to the viewer to figure out and everything in this film is very predictable. It's a fantasy film so we can't talk about believable here but I feel it could've been done a lot better. There are also some things that are just plain stupid, and really could've been avoided - the use of the blade in the dress, climbing with a crown, using a broad sword twice the size of herself... she goes from struggling to being superhuman - it really just spoils it. I don't wanna ruin the movie for you, but the ending was really a huge disappointment as well - guess they wanted a big finish - again so predictable and totally unnecessary. Would have been better if the retribution was more focused. The antagonist being only one person seems kind of off and they could've made use of the people in the red robes a bit more and developed that - the mother son combo just didn't seem really evil or especially villainous."," Aesthetically beautiful, but boring"

It's well filmed and there are not many dull moments but it has a very unoriginal plot and it is very shallow without any complexity in terms of plot or character development, similar to marvel movies. Maybe I should have read up but my conception of fantasy shows and movies is that it's normally layered upon years and years of story told throughout various books but this is kinda just an action movie dressed in fantasy clothing.

I understand that she's hurt but its just too much that it could be on Onlyfans"" well.. thats because her entire left (or right i forgor) calf got burnt, scratches all around her body, tired, have not eaten, And she had to jump over to a big gap in that cave with only one knife she had from her dress. That explains why.3rd. ""Why is she asking for help to the ppl from the.. pit.. where she thrown off to in the first place? (?) (im sorry english is my 2nd language, you r probably understand if u have watched the movie). She just woke up from falling to the terrifying scary pit. And we don't know how long has she been unconscious. She wasn't in her right mind, so she scaredly, not knowing anything, and screamed for help. Of course nobody's answering, probably everyone had left.4th. ""She left her stabbed mother and took the mother's horse"" yeah, because Elodie's sister is a replacement of the sacrifice 😊 even her mom said ""its okay, i can manage the wound, save your sister blabla"". And on top of that, horse is much faster than human. If she chose to run, it would be take too long because she is wounded, and tired. Do you want her to take back her mother first to the ship and after that she will save her sister? There will be no time for that. Her mother's stabbed wound maybe not as bad as we thinik bcs the blood is barely coming out, maybe the corset helped her a lil bit.5th. I forgot so im gonna end it here, but one thing. I do agree someone said ""she always gets up even if she's badly hurt"" i agree, very agree. But thats literally so common among protagonists especially in action movies, shows, animes. Thats the power for being a protagonist lmao. So yeah, i hope you get to watch this movie without get influenced by some bad reviews. Watch it then read the reviews. And dont put too much high expectations bcs when it's not what you expect you will be disappointed :) and that is for every movies. Judge after watch! Okay have fun.Oh yeah, when she stabbed the dragon in the tummy, yeah its kinda weird for someone who has never trained for sword master (?) but who knows, maybe in her kingom she... train herself lmao."," Mostly Weird"

Ok yeah. You only needed a dragon....but it's ok because the dragon is female!There is a part in this movie where Millie's character gets thrown down a dark deep hole, after hitting the ground and regaining consciousness and doing a bit of thinking she has a moment of realization "" I'm the sacrifice!?""

It could go either way depending on the story.What I care about, is the fact that the entire movie just happens in one freaking cave, with one single fantastic creature: a generic unoriginal dragon.I also find it weird that a dragon can hurt itself with its fire breath. It's like being able to harm your skin with your own spit...So yeah, there's nothing really original, and the scenery is very limited."," Technically brilliant but a poor script and runtime let it down"

However, between the dragon that can hear everything, then not the very audible screaming; spews napalm to kill, then doesn't (like burn the crystals); to enormous continuity errors - the blue slugs only occur in the cave, then they are in the pool in the dragon's den; what happened to the birds? How did she go from a pit to a high crevasse in a mountain? Her very serious burn moves from right collarbone to left; and her face has cuts, then doesn't.For sure this movie requires suspension of disbelief, but those kinds of discontinuities are just insurmountable.MBB's performance is solid.

This is truly a most mediocre movie, a more or less soulless rehash of well-known and overused stories, woven together without much skill and intelligence, creativity. Anyway, Damsel is like too many movies these days - produced, directed, and written by people without any heart for the art of movie-making. It's no more art but work. What else? Production and acting are sufficient, special effects meandering between solid and rather bad computer game cinematic. Final words, Damsel is boring, redundant, generic, and as plastic as it gets - not one character one really cares about, because, well, they are all just a copy of a copy of a copy. And the revelation or twist in the end is so predictable, that it is really just lame: a couple of days ago I put Krull again on my plate - it's (almost) Citizen Kane compared to Damsel.

It is as predictable as it is slow to get going, but I at least enjoyed the production and visuals throughout! The cast is okay, and nothing else. This would make for an excellent short, where many elements are trimmed (the ""Augur of Ebrietas"" slugs).. as most characters are as simplistic and shallow as shown immediately after their quick introductions, so the rest of the story would remain intact.Personally, I don't appreciate movies that have little to nothing to say."," ""I think I had a limited definition of wealthy"""

Once it actually gets to the central idea of cat and mouse between a Princess and a Dragon it's a lot stronger, powering through on the momentum of the endless chase.Despite a few big names in the supporting cast, Millie Bobby Brown really carries this. There's some really clunky lines of dialogue here and she delivers them with enough conviction to make them work. Shohreh Aghdashloo voicing the Dragon is inspired casting that really helps it get going after the weak opening.Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's direction does a lot to help this Netflix original come closer to looking like a real movie compared to a lot of what's come before.

But it didn't start there. It was predictable from the start. It was obvious the marriage was a sham and of course the prince would betray her, he's a straight white male. I was a little surprised they killed a black knight,but he was a man so I wasn't too surprised.They wrote the dragon trying to be exactly like smaug, except stupid since she could have killed the girl a few different times. The message of underestimating women was very clear although I'm sure the writers thought they were being clever and subtle.The acting was terrible and over the top. The only actress that was convincing at all was the evil queen and the girls father, although there roles were so small that maybe they only seemed ok because they didn't have enough screen time to mess it up.The only thing this movie had going for it was that the main character didn't just breeze through. She did have to struggle a couple of times and she did get hurt even though it was only slightly compared to what had actually happened to her.Poor acting

Lead-up to the whole dragon situation takes way too long and it doesn't matter much for the rest of the plot. You could cut out first 20 minutes of the film and jump right into her being thrown into the pit after the wedding ceremony. At least you'd have some mystery to unravel while watching. Instead, by that time, you're one-third into the runtime it's obvious who's good, who's bad, who's gonna be punished in the end. What is left is the ""dragon part"" of the movie.Said dragon magically changes size several times throughout the viewing experience. In one scene it fills the whole cave, in another it's a size of the elephans, in another it looms over half a castle. A little indicator that they didn't care enough to make even obvious things consistent.Dragon itself is not even inteligent or interesting enough. It's just angry and a bit dangerous. When it almost has its prey in its grasp it decides to go away for one reason or another, giving Elodie room to progress with the plot. Dragon is not defeated, outsmarted or subdued. It doesn't make sense. Whole conclusion to the story is lackluster at best. Some of the dialogues are cringe instead of emotional and inspiring. Watched it with my wife last night and this movie had our eyes rolling on more than one occassion. We really couldn't wait for it to finish so we can watch something else.I think it might be targetted to a younger audience, but then there's a scene where a flock of birds is basically burned alive while flying away from the dragon, which is unnecessarily cruel for a kids movie.If you're an adult with half a brain you should probably skip this one."," Dull, predictable and cringe"

She's definitely eye candy and isn't a bad actress. The movie is mostly about her so she has a lot of screen time. The special effects and CGI's were of good quality.

It reminded me a little of 2008's Journey to the Center of the Earth in how imaginative it gets visually.The design of the dragon is splendidly ferocious. Her voice and dialogue contribute to her menacing presence.

"147","Damsel","smaniatopoulos","8/10","10 March 2024","Hollywood lately always fails to get it right. Usually because of too much CGI and explosions instead of story telling, but mostly because it has replaced smart scripts with political agendas and vehicles to promote and push sequels to every new franchise it tries to launch. Super hero movies are idiotic and serve more as platforms. Comedies are insulting and unfunny. Historical dramas care more about inclusion than history. And the list goes on.It was therefore quite surprising to see that for once they went the other way and instead of selling one more scifi or fantasy movie that would hopefully (for them) serve as a vehicle for some new trilogy, they opted to make a classic good old fashioned movie with a beginning, a middle and an end.Damsel is not one more CGI fest, it has no twists or surprises, but follows one of the most classic plots of the genre: ""good princess gets betrayed by evil queen"". Millie Bobby Brown gives a very physical performance and she is really good as you can see she out her heart in making the pain and effort completely genuine, she reminded me of Bruce Willis in Die Hard, so kudos to her.Do not expect something outstanding in terms of originality: Damsel is pretty straightforward. But it is shot with passion, energy and the purpose to tell the story right, and as such it is a great fun watch for the whole family.However, at times it becomes a little scary and violent, so I would not recommend it for kids under 10.Damsel is really good because it succeeds at being exactly what it's meant to be: a fairytale not gone bad.8/10."," An old school fairytale"

Imagine if this were a comedy during which the new princess is confronted by her husband's crazy family; so crazy that in the end she decides to return to her poverty in the proverbial pumpkin.Alas, this isn't intended to be funny. Instead, we've got a dragon that speaks human language and, equally important, understands it as well. We've got an underground cavern which as though by miracle turns into a sky-high precipice. An evil queen. A weak-kneed prince. A guy in a bad toupee and a crown who I assume is the king but does not have a single word of dialogue. We've got important plot points that are, for no good reason, withheld from the viewer.On the plus side: The dragon flies real nice.Milly Bobby Brown is our heroine 'princess' and I guess she's OK in the role, though I doubt this film is going to do her any good. I have a hunch that there hasn't been a lot of film offers coming her way and so when this one did, she took it. Which does not explain Robin Wright accepting the role as evil queen, or Ray Winstone as the princess' scheming father. These are established talents. They have reputations.

Moreover, it missed a chance to delve deeper into illustrating the profound impact of the bomb on Japan.Not sure why this movie is/was shown at IMAX but I'm glad I watched it at home over two days because I almost fell asleep twice.This movie is an hour too long and probably one of Christopher Nolan's worst films."," Great acting but challenging to sit through"
"153","Oppenheimer","professormax","9/10","4 December 2023","Again the usa is shown as the good boys fighting evil, they didnt show scenes tha compromise the great americans, no scenes of the bomb or the japanese people, if you want to see a good movie that shows some scenes about the war, try the movie of Marie Curie that is a British movie that has balls ro show japaneses playing, children and honest adults when the bomb falls in Nagazaki. The director of oppenheimer is not so good, so I was expecting nothing more than a fictional grade 5 movie. The movie is boring, confusing but at least show that americans cant trust even in their own scientists, they made a witch hunt for the ones that they considered a menace for the nation, some questions werent answered, important questions as what hapenned to oppenheimer? Did he stay working for the government, was he tempted to change sides after seeing that the government didnt trust him? What happened to the city near the tests place?"," Completly fictional movie"
"154","Oppenheimer","sasquatch-89510","9/10","1 January 2024","I held off seeing this movie until it was available to buy on Prime, and I don't think I've ever been more underwhelmed by a film relative to the hype. The scenes were cut in a very confusing way, there was a loud annoying stomping soundtrack that appeared in scenes that didn't need it, and the plot focused on some of the less interesting aspects of the Manhattan project. Why spend so much on a hollywood blockbuster and focus the plot around the security clearance and idiosyncrasies of one person and retrodding on themes about nuclear weapons that we've heard for decades in countless other films? I've studied WWII for years and feel fairly educated in the manhatten project, and I found the plot found the most boring way possible to portray the period, the project and the people involved.And then there's the...explosion. So much hype about the explosion scene and how CGI wasn't used, and it showed. Anyone can go on youtube and see the trinity blast and dozens of other nuclear blasts, and the one shown in this film did NOT look like a nuclear blast. It looked like a slow motion close-up of a gas can exploding."," Super underwhelming"

I felt that I did not get out of the movie knowing Oppenheimer more.It's true that the explosion scene was a master class but again Nolan has all the means to unleash some quality scene like these. Action and technical scenes are nothing fancy for him !Gary Oldman ; LEGENDARY in very few shots.Clearly, the means were there, the story, the cast but the mixture was overdone ...I cannot help but say that there were better biopics ; a beautiful mind, the theory of everything, ... this one not that crazy.The SCORE was forgettable ... very much so !"," Not better than Tenet ; Honestly"

However the second Leg of the film is quite boring and pretty uninteresting. I would probably class the film in the lower end of nolan's films. The acting is however great, performances were probably some of the best. I've seen this year. Certain scenes that have been mentioned a lot in the media, I do agree are not necessary and had no impact on my experience of the film and it did feel out of place.

"157","Oppenheimer","chells-88696","9/10","29 March 2024","After this movie's Oscar sweep, I came to it expecting much more--from the visuals, the script, the sound (incl. Film score), the acting, and the directing. Perhaps some viewers knew next to nothing about the race for the atomic bomb or about the appeal of the Communist Party to Western intellectuals in the 1930s or about the dog-eat-dog bureaucracy of secretive ""war""committees in Washington D. C. Or perhaps viewers have never seen a movie by Fellini (""81/2"") or Robert Altman (""Nashville""), or Alain Resnais (""Hiroshima, mon amor"").At the very least, read John Hersey's still relevant ""Hiroshima,"" which I found far more informative and valuable than ""Oppenheimer"" in spite of the IMAX treatment Nolan's film has received (why the IMAX ratio? For the 5-minute scene of an experimental detonation of Oppenheimer's pet project?).I was going to flesh out each of my categories, but I see that numerous reviewers have beat me to it. Anyway, how does one review acting when the script is so short on characterization and so preoccupied with the bomb that actors are denied the opportunity to deepen their roles? The scene with Oppenheimer meeting Truman was so brief, rushed and shallow that, for me, it represented the same deficiencies of this entire overrated project--a ""glorified documentary."".Perhaps worst of all, the Oscar noise about this film has given audiences an excuse not to take seriously the film about the virtuoso musician viewed by many as the most important musical artist in American history. Does anyone realize, or even care, that for the brief but powerful scene in which he conducts Mahler's grandiose, epic Second Symphony, Bradley Cooper had worked for 2 years to capture the distinctive conducting style of Bernstein?If any movie was worthy of the IMAX-treatment--for visual impact as well as awesome sound--that scene alone was more radioactive than Nolan's disappointing 3-hour film about America's first big WMD. At the very least, those who applaud ""Oppenheimer"" for its subject matter or for the acting of Robert Downey Jr. Would be well advised to view Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"" (with Peter Sellers'' unforgettable performance as 3 different characters)."," If you think this is challenging, try ""Hiroshima, mon amour"""

They're just annoying and tiresome. Same goes for the heavy-handed and over the top score. I felt that most of this was in service of the director's ego rather than the film itself.I quite like Christopher Nolan films - Memento was excellent - but this was tedious drivel.I watched the 1980 BBC series (on Amazon) after watching the film and, old-fashioned though it was, thought it was much better (although closer to 7 hours rather than 3).

It's worth seeing, to be sure, but I think it's one of those overhyped productions that will be lost in the dusty film archive where pomposity goes to die.The sound level, which the theater insists was set according to strict instructions from the studio, was abusively loud.

Once every two minute we were jolted out of our seats by sudden heavy sounds, presumably aimed at waking us up. Yes, they got our attention. Also, some characters were given parts to play that left nothing to be imagined. Strauss, for instance, came across as untrustworthy from the first glance he gave the camera.

At the end of the movie, I just felt that a lot of facts were poured into my head. Direction is slightly above average.

It can't decide what it wants to be, so it's not really anything - not just for the viewer, but for the creator. And that's a problem. It's not good as a biopic: there are serious historical flaws in the story, which irritated me. I'm a huge fan of John von Neumann... anyone, who knows who he was understands why I mention him. As a drama? The movie can't decide the centre of the drama. It's too weak as a spy-story, too weak as a political drama, too weak as a personal drama. Not one aspect is worked out to carry the film. The strongest aspect was how many times in american history the ""what you did 20 years ago is more important than who you become and what your expertese is"" ruined people's lives. Or at least was used as a political rethoric against opponents. And I appreciated that, hence the 5 points. As a moral/personal evolution the moral conflict isn't built up, the ""evolution of a scientist"" dies away halfway and doesn't really connect with the ""organizer scientist"". The ""science should or should not have moral boundaries"" isn't worked out and built up, just comes and goes without a purpose. The only detactable personal evolution is the ""man of future becomes the man of past"", but somehow that remains too weak in the end, too.

"176","Oppenheimer","Jeremy_Urquhart","8/10","20 July 2023","One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"177","Oppenheimer","Orlando_Gardner","9/10","19 July 2023","You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion.

"179","Oppenheimer","MrDHWong","10/10","20 July 2023","""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10."," A brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws"
"180","Oppenheimer","and_mikkelsen","10/10","20 July 2023","This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!"," Nolan delivers a powerfull biopic that shows the dark side of human nature!"
"181","Oppenheimer","Geekofriendly","8/10","26 July 2023","I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb."," Nolan touches greatness, falls slightly short"
"182","Oppenheimer","dweston-38669","10/10","25 July 2023","Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad."," Oppen-bore-mer"
"183","Oppenheimer","mark-217-307033","8/10","19 July 2023","I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end."," And the Oscar goes to..."

"186","Oppenheimer","timmyhollywood","10/10","23 July 2023","Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10."," Breaks all filmmaklng rules, but not in a good way"
"187","Oppenheimer","Dvir971","6/10","19 July 2023","Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

"188","Oppenheimer","EShy","4/10","25 July 2023","I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing."," This just might be as interesting as this topic can get"
"189","Oppenheimer","aharmas","9/10","22 July 2023","It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

"190","Oppenheimer","TheBigSick","8/10","28 July 2023","0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film."," Overlong and Overcomplicated"
"191","Oppenheimer","Zay-Fee","8/10","20 July 2023","Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves."," Exceptional storytelling and Genius Cinametography"
"192","Oppenheimer","leestoych","8/10","22 July 2023","At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10."," Technically superb but..."
"193","Oppenheimer","zeki-4","10/10","20 July 2023","Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

"196","Oppenheimer","ib011f9545i","10/10","24 July 2023","When I was at school in Scotland in the 1970s there was a textbook called physics is fun,I never agreed with this book.Nolan is not the first person to tackle this story,the BBC did a 6 part series in 1980 called Oppenheimer,in 1989 Paul Newman made a film called fat man and little boy.These productions are obscure and I don't mind Nolan covering the story.This is a great film but it lacks pace and drama.It is a 3 hour film divided between 1 part Oppeheimer's life before the Manhattan project,1 part about the Manhattan project and the final part Oppenheimer's fall from grace.This is a complex and detailed story but I can't say Nolan handles it well.I have see the previous versions of this story and wrote an essay about the decision to bomb Hiroshima when studying history at university.I also have a good grasp of the events of WW2 and the Cold War.So the issues covered in this film are not new to me but the level of detail is sometimes numbing.The final third of the film covers Oppenheimer's post war problems and this section drags.The film is very well made but it lacks enough memorable scenes.The sound and music are exceptional.This is a biopic and what are we to make of the character of Oppenheimer?He seems to have been an arrogant genius who was a womaniser who had several public faces displayed at different times.The film has a large cast and it is hard to work out who is who at times.But all in all I say is that this is a great film despite it's flaws."," this is a great film but lacks pace and drama"
"197","Oppenheimer","andy_c_les","6/10","3 August 2023","The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss."," Too loud and too long"

My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet."," Stunning - put it in a time capsule"
"199","Oppenheimer","GoatOfNeptune",NA,"22 July 2023","Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia."," Half an Hour too long, misses the point"
"200","Oppenheimer","heykateforever",NA,"17 February 2024","I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!! Period!!"," Bloated, talky, unnecessarily complicated."
