"1","Argylle","omnimog","4/10","18 February 2024","First part, I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. I knew that the movie had gotten some bad reviews, but I had not read any of them. And I found myself thinking ""but this is a great, over the top, spy action comedy, what is not to love about that!"".Then midways, something happens, and the movie spirals into all kinds of problems.Firstly, it drags out for way, way, way too long. From fantastical action and good one liners it turns into a snore fest with redundant, lengthy scenes trying to establish some sense of emotional gravitas. Problem is, BDH has zero range, and became nothing but annoying and downright bad at what she was supposed to after.Secondly, it bacame clear that it was style over substance. Which I one hundred percent can support, if the style is cool, creative, innovative, fun, esthetically pleasing. It never fully was, and it never really committed, becoming a jigsaw of puzzle pieces forced together that really did not fit.Thirdly, under utilized actors. Lots of great small roles, none got to shine, and especially SLJ had one of his worst roles for years, mostly reduced to acting like an excited 5 yo in the end.In the end, the movie was somewhat saved by an always fun and excellent Sam Rockwell. And unfortunately dragged down massively by, I'm sincerely sorry to say, a typically bad BDH. Not often I say this but the casting director really picked the wrong main actress with this one."," A movie of two distinct halves"
"2","Argylle","brentsbulletinboard","5/10","4 February 2024","It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it."," Seriously Disappointing, Even as Goofy Fun"
"3","Argylle","jack_o_hasanov_imdb","6/10","10 February 2024","There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clich√©s in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn't perfect, but I think it's spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the ""Kingsman"" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining."," Alfie the Cat"
"4","Argylle","FeastMode","5/10","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)"," What are you doing to me, Matthew?"
"5","Argylle","malmevik77","7/10","2 February 2024","ArgylleA very hyped movie from the writer of the Kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, Bryce Dallas Howard screaming and a cat that's supposedly awesome or something. At first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.The ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill's hair is absolutely terrible. Dua Lipa's appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. Sam Rockwell continues a trend in Hollywood where age can be defied as I forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of Tom Cruise and Jason Statham.The movie is way too long and needed a better editor. I like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.Now, on to the fun. This movie makes the word ""ridiculous"" woefully inadequate. But it's a fun ridiculous. There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.There are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.I enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. Don't take the movie seriously, and I believe you will too. The entire, very long, ending sequence is just crazy with the suspension of disbelief, but embrace it."," Not plausible, but a laugh out loud silly spy movie"
"6","Argylle","SAMTHEBESTEST","3/10","2 February 2024","Argylle (2024) :
Movie Review :Argylle Review: Spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life,"" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, ""Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" That's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That's how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.Argylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.The writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. That's why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. That's too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.On the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.RATING - 3/10*"," Matthew Vaughan's Spy-Action-Comedy Is Messy & Illogical"

"8","Argylle","eddie_baggins","2/10","2 February 2024","Not usually one for ill-advised early predictions, I can't imagine there will be too many worse scenes sighted on the big screen for me in 2024 than the sight of a mis-cast and poorly CGI'd Bryce Dallas Howard skating across an oil slick in improvised knife skates taking on a room full of incompetent goons.Now we all know and understand that January and early February are earmarked year after year as a dumping ground for the films Hollywood has little faith in, projects that come and go with often little fuss and fanfare and often for good reason, but sometimes there really is no excuse.With this in mind, one would think that heading cautiously into Matthew Vaughn's new $100+ million dollar spy action comedy romp would prepare one to lower expectations significantly enough to find some type of enjoyment from this star-studded affair but unfortunately this newest outing from a director who once produced some of the more fun and energetic Hollywood vehicles is a wet blanket of a ride, providing a drab and DOA offering that's an early contender for 2024's worst Hollywood release.At a minimum 30-40 minutes too long for even the most forgiving of viewers, it's hard to fathom that the boorish and lifeless caper we are laying witness to here is from the same mind of the man that oversaw cult favourite Layer Cake, well-liked superhero flick Kick-Ass and the box office smash that was The Kingsman with Argylle sharing similar themes and concepts as those films but none of their charm, smarts or energy, all elements that appear desperate to make themselves apparent here but never coming to fruition.With a central concept that on paper could provide a fun, frantic and thrilling film, the idea of Dallas Howard's cat loving homebody writer Elly Conway getting caught up in the real world of spy's and espionage when Sam Rockwell's real life agent Aiden Wilde comes onto the scene has some serious cinematic potential and with the likes of Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson and John Cena along for the ride it's not like Argylle lacks for talent in bringing Vaughn's vision to life but from early on Argylle gets caught in a rut it's never able to climb out of, that no matter the amount of ""twists"" or bizarre end credit sequences were going to be able to help it escape from.What makes the failings of Argylle to succeed, even to a minor degree of throwaway entertainment values, is the fact that this inept film wastes the talents of everyone involved too such a large degree.It becomes sad rather early on that we have to endure watching talents such as Dallas Howard and Rockwell lower themselves so here, with Dallas Howard the recipient of a terrible case of miscasting as Conway with her role morphing more and more into one that feels unsuited to her abilities while Rockwell's well-known and respected ability in comedic minded affairs is wasted on Wilde, a character who is anything like his namesakes surname with everyone else here barely raising a sweat with underwritten and underutilised characters that get lost in amongst all the so-called thrilling action that looks more at home in a mid-budget video game than a well-financed Apple original.Arriving in cinemas around the globe when the industry desperately needs some wins in what's going to be a mostly rough period following on from 2023's significant Hollywood strikes, Argylle is the exact type of original cinematic offering we didn't need and a reminder that a decent idea does not instantly a good movie make.Final Say -Loaded with talent, potential and a budget that should at the very minimum allow for some memorable spectacle, Argylle is a shockingly inept new release from a director that should know better, with Matthew Vaughn's turkey marking itself down as a strong early contender for 2024's most notable big budget failure.1 cat backpack out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"," An early contender for 2024's worst Hollywood film"

"10","Argylle","chenp-54708","3/10","31 January 2024","Matthew Vaughn is a filmmaker who is hit or miss as I enjoyed some of works on Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. Argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.Throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. The action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. Most of the performances were just...fine. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. Henry Cavill is just Henry Cavill.Vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. Because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.With good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful CGI moments throughout. My god that CGI cat is horrendous. The dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something AI would make.I think it's safe to say Matthew Vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining."," Lol no"
"11","Argylle","kevin_robbins","1/10","3 February 2024","My wife and I watched Argylle (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline revolves around a world-renowned author of spy novels facing a writer's block. She seeks to visit her mother to overcome her mental block, only to discover on her way there her books' are non-fictional and have an impact on reality. What other secrets about her abilities does she remain unaware of?Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass), the film stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), John Cena (Peacemaker), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction).This movie is a complete disaster. It's been a long time since I've seen something this bad. Despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only Sam Rockwell's character being hit or miss. Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. The final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson's wine analogy falls flat. Henry Cavill and John Cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. The ending hints at an ""Argylle/Kingsman"" Apple+ TV series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?In conclusion, Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for. I would score this a 1/10 and strongly recommend skipping it."," Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of establishing the television series spinoff they hoped for"
"12","Argylle","cdjh-81125","5/10","2 February 2024","Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me."," What Happened To Matthew Vaughn?"

Is it fun? YES!!I don't know where we went off the rails as an audience that we get more enjoyment in dumping on everything than just sitting back and taking in something lighthearted and fun. I went in expecting some kind of Romancing the Stone / 2022's Lost City style story and was instead zig-zagged through countless twists that others have criticized as one-too-many, but I felt were just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Yes, it ran a tad bit long, but I can't imagine what I would relegate to the cutting room floor.It's full of twists and turns, beautiful and original fight sequences, and romance. Like Aidan says at some point in regards to Elly's writing - we don't need another Sense and Sensibility (or something to that degree).

"14","Argylle","alex_with_a_P","3/10","31 January 2024","Oof, I was looking forward seeing the new film by Matthew Vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. Big mistake. I honestly don't know where to start. So I start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. ""What happened to action movies?""
I have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. If you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. Not only is everything CGI like any of the action films Netflix churns out by the week. The badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. Every time. Now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. But this is the whole movie. I could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. Even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. And I'm not at the edge of my seat when I see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. Hell, even the cat is CG ninety-nine percent of the time. I saw this on regular IMAX but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' I got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3D to make an extra buck. The schtick with cross-cutting Henry Cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.I must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a French comedy film (La Ch√®vre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' (1996) rip-off. But the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. And they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: The actors.I don't want to talk too much about Bryce Dallas Howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. She is a obviously corpulent, which I thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. It makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. But the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. Here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but I guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. Instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, Bradley James Allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in Vaug's films. More unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like Sam Rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. I don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. He is worse here than in Seven Psychopaths (2012). Bryan Cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. Most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. Some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, I really want to blame AI for this. Scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. We have an exciting scene with Sam Jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own Kingman film). I leave it at that. And want to end with another question. Can we please get old school movies back?"," Nothing is real anymore"

-I enjoyed a lot of the comedy in this movie, despite how cheeky and over the top it can be sometime.-Argylle uses a lot of tactics to get a laugh, including: sarcasm, straight up delivery, unbelievable stunts, cheesy moments, and some slapstick that helps go with the flow of the Vaughn movie.-Balanced into a surprising degree, it doesn't go too farfetched for viewers like me and helps blend that comic book quality with real life that meshes well for me and keeps the movie in that fun area that the first two Kingsman did well.Music
-Absolutely one of my favorite elements, Vaughn's group has helped pull the right tracks together that are used so intelligently to accomplish a lot of things.-Sometimes the song is just funny, that perfect touch to go with the theme, sell the thoughts, and add that background noise that hits scene by scene in the sequence to bring everything together
-Other times, the song is just catchy, very energetic, upbeat, and with the sound effects, that culmination of sound engineering that gets me pumped to find the right song.-It's dynamic, it's quirky, and it really just has the Vaughn feeling behind it that I've loved in most of the spy ring craziness.The Fun
-Like Kingsman movies 1 and 2, the movie for me was just fun.-It didn't get too caught up in the politics and agendas of the world, but went back to that ludicrous story that blended many elements together into an engaging piece that kept my attention.-And yet, still has a story that helps ground it and lead to a more well-rounded experience that avoids (mostly) getting caught up on an element or gimmick to bash it into paste.The Story:
-I won't say it's the best, but the movie still holds candor for elevating the film past just knock off jokes and violent punches.-Argylle's story actually gives some character development in two of the title characters, helping focus on the story elements and less on the power player role that I very much enjoyed.-A little bit of world building, alongside some engaging elements really gave me characters to follow, and upped the stakes a bit to help accomplish much in the short time period.The Action To Some Degree
-Vaughn knows how to make memorable action sequences and this movie still shows his creative elements coming to life.-The early stuff surprisingly is grounded, a bit more traditional outside of a few stunts that scream Rockwell fervor.-Near the end though, most of the bouts are totally in the comic book aspect, over the top, flashy, funny, and downright corny that I couldn't help but love everything coming together.-If that's not your element, chances are this movie wasn't for you, but for fans of the extreme Kingsman brand, stick around for the latter hour of the movie to get your wishes.The Acting
-Once again, I'll focus on the three actors with the most time and/or have the most build up, or else we'll be here all night.-Cavill is fine for the time he is on screen. He's got the sex appeal of the Pierce Brosnan spy, the delivery that works with the role, and yet the humor in the later portions of the movie. It's just too bad he isn't on screen enough to really blend it all together to the max (more on that later)
-Rockwell is Rockwell, fantastic at what he does and bringing his trade sarcasm with it. In this film, he's sarcastic, drops one-liners, just naturally humorous to me, and yet has that moment of vulnerability down that shows how talented he is.-But Howard surprised me with her props in this film, once more proving she can give more layered roles. She's nerdy, she's anxious, she's loving, and so much more, all brought together to make this odd situation believable, and often avoiding the annoying levels that this thing could have gone into.The Pace, Mostly
-And like most of the spy-action entries in this director's list, the pace is engaging for me given the balance of faster walking through the scenes, but slowing down to still smell the roses.-Argylle does its best to find the right ratio of storytelling, world building, and action, all to help further uncover the mystery of this writer's talents and the truth they are seeking.-And for much of the film, I admit they accomplished a lot and made the 2 hour and 17 minute run time feel better than I anticipated, and that is impressive in this day and age when you can complete a story in that time range.DISLIKES:The CGI Needs Work
-Some corners were cut in this film and one of them was the CGI of the film.-It is not the worst thing I've seen, but there are a lot of moments where the budget cuts and stretched graphics stood out and could be a tad annoying when not used right.-Whether this is during the action scenes, or sometime the backgrounds, Argylle's tech prowess needs some work to obtain the same prowess it did in the past and not get so blurred by the limitations of CGI.The Action Could Have Been Better
-Argylle keeps the action a little closer on the pulse of reality, forgoing the usual effects for much of the first part of the film and keeping it more of a straight shooter, brawler, with just a little twist.-Eventually we get to the roots, but for this limitation for me, the stunts just needed to be a little more spread out and hold that wow factor Vaughn's work is known to have.-Where were the over the top car stunts or off the wall blasts? Where was that pinnacle end fight that didn't feel so last minute and a stretch to fit another twist into the mix.-And though much of it does become balanced, I can't help but think there was still some more tweaking to be done to help find that balance the first Kingsman accomplished for me.A Few Too Many Twists?-I agree with the reviewers that perhaps Fuchs got a tad carried away with the number of twists in this movie.-Argylle is loaded to the nines with plots twists. Some of these are good, and others feel forced and added on at the end in some vain attempt to try and break a record.-They aren't all bad, but at some point, the amount of twists and surprises gets to the point of annoying for me and they could have cut a few things to help finessed the story and help on some of the other dislikes above.-Perhaps that straight and narrow could have gone a bit more to help achieve the same wow factor for ArgylleBalancing Of Actors Needs Improvement
--For me the biggest limitation is by far the balancing of the cast and the characters that get promoted in the commercial.-Rockwell and Howard have the most screen time, but after that, most of the rest of the cast is in these fleeting moments, with only Cavill eking out a few more moments.-True, they all have that memorable factor, but I know there was a lot more they could have done with them, more inclusion and bending the story around their involvement like the first part of the movie.-Samuel L Jackson, Cena, Dua Lipa, and more just felt like they got the shaft on this film, and though better than some movies, Argylle still shows what loading up on a cast can do if not balanced.The VERDICT:Argylle was a lot of fun for this reviewer, and was a lot better than the prequel a few years ago for the series. The primary reason is just Vaughn pulling his magic of blending so many things into an entertaining piece and finding the way to just make it energetic and fun. Some decent acting to deliver the lines, character development, escalating action and plenty of comedy all mesh well and optimize the feelings Vaughn knows how to make come alive. An engaging pace and just that entertainment value were all elements I loved and found worthy of the theater visit. Yet, it still has room to improve to get back to the first Kingsman for me. The action gradually gets to that exciting level, but feels a bit stiff to begin with as the move finds ground. The twists and pacing need a bit more sprucing up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair I know this director can bring. Yet, it's the CGI and the character integration that are the weakest elements, and no amount of catchy music and humor is going to offset that several key players were fairly absent. Still, I give this movie a solid go to and had fun with the theater experience, so I encourage others to get it a try at the theater if possible.My scores are:Action/Thriller: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0."," Had Fun For Awhile, Argylle"
"16","Argylle","Chance_Boudreaux19","4/10","1 February 2024","Argylle is a long, dumb, CGI-riddled mess. In other words, it's the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. I'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn't care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.Furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would've helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome."," Stupid nonsense with a five minute Henry Cavill Bond demo reel"
"17","Argylle","shayenu","7/10","31 January 2024","Have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.When the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movieThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.This fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.Ultimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!"," Argylle - It's really dumb, but it's also fun."
"18","Argylle","Nixon_Carmichael","4/10","31 January 2024","And from Matthew Vaughn comes Argyle, probably the first legit action movie of 2024, however unlike its predecessor Plane in January of 2023, Argyle doesn't know exactly what it wants to be and the movie suffers from that.Argyle is a tale of three movies, one is an over the top fantasy movie, one is a hyper crazy spy movie and one is well...out there. Let's just say straight away that the visual effects in this movie are a mess. I don't know if this movie is yet another victim of the near third world conditions of effects houses or if it's just bad shot creation.Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard bring their respective A games and there are no complaints there. Henry Cavill, in little more than a cameo, does his part admirably as well. I have to wonder if there is another version of this one where Henry Cavill has more screen time.At the end of the day, though Matthew Vaughn has been one of my favourite filmmakers over the past number of years, this one isn't one of his better offerings. It's not the worst thing that I've ever seen, and there is fun to be had here, but I'm not going to lie and say that this is a good movie. To Matthew Vaughn I say ""Chin up, go get em' next time."""," Well, that was hideous. More CGI sludge. Poor Matthew Vaughn."
"19","Argylle","Fatboy1972","1/10","3 February 2024","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would have walked out if I hadn't paid for it which disappointed me because there were so many people in that I'm a fan off. I can't remember laughing one time during the entire movie. I didn't see the twists coming in the movie but even as good as those were, it was nowhere near enough to come close to saving this movie. I'm not a John Cena fan but he was not even close to being the worst part of this movie. There's a post credit scene that came on as I was walking out and I didn't even bother going back to watch it because there's no way I'm watching a sequel."," Just don't"
"20","Argylle","brijeshcs-18820","6/10","31 January 2024","This film would have been a hit if released in the 70s or 80s. Unfortunately, for the current audience, it falls short of expectations, especially for those anticipating a show akin to Kingsman.Positive:
Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie."," Disappointed-Cena and Henry's screen time almost matched the trailer, Trailer is better than whole movie."
"21","Argylle","FlashCallahan","2/10","5 February 2024","Elly Conway is the reclusive author of a series of best-selling espionage novels, whose idea of bliss is a night at home with her computer and her cat, Alfie.But when the plots of Elly's fictional books, which centre on secret agent Argylle and his mission to unravel a global spy syndicate begin to mirror the covert actions of a real-life spy organisation, quiet evenings at home become a thing of the past.Accompanied by Aidan, a cat-allergic spy, Elly races across the world to stay one step ahead of the killers as the line between Elly's fictional world and her real one begins to blur.....Vaughn has made some really good films such as Layer Cake, and Stardust. But when he does bad, he does really bad, such as The Kings Man, and this, which to no surprise, lives in the same world as The Kingsman film. Because these days, you have to have a multiverse....And this is complete dreck, and probably the poorest effort thus far by the director. He needs Jane Goldman back in his life.What we have here is nothing more than a very poor written action film, with no heart, no soul, and devoid of any joy. We get special guest stars turning up every now and again explaining the plot to Elly, poorly choreographed set pieces with some good non-diegetic music, and a plot twist that is so poor, so stupid, so inane, that it makes the Martha scene from Batman V Superman look like The Sixth Sense.But it's an Apple film, so it cost the earth, and credit where credits due, it looks good at times, but this won't affect any bodies career, as Apple could make five of these a week and they wouldn't suffer.They just let the audience suffer.Insufferable."," Bah-gylle....."
"22","Argylle","neil-476","9/10","10 February 2024","Elly is on her 5th successful novel about superspy Argyle (played out visually by Henry Cavill) when she finds herself caught up-in real life spy shenanigans. To say any more would spoiler things, and I don't want to do that because the implausible plot twists are all part of the fun.If you enjoyed Kingsman, you will enjoy this. It, too, isn't believable in the slightest, but that doesn't stop you enjoying the romp. And if you enjoyed the Busby Berkeley exploding heads sequence in Kingsman, you ain't seen nothing yet. The action sequences here are nothing short of hysterical.Bryce Dallas Howard enjoys a role which gives her plenty of opportunity to have fun, although the gown she wears during the climax doesn't flatter her. Nice callback to Jurassic World, though.This is just plain draft, over the top fun."," Utter nonsense, but hugely entertaining"
"23","Argylle","kjproulx","7/10","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn has always been a director I have admired. Whether you are talking about his earlier works in Layer Cake or Stardust, or his over-the-top action films in Kick-Ass or The Kingsman films, I have never disliked his work until recently. It was not until 2021's The King's Man that I found his work to feel a little stale. That film didn't work for me on many levels, but I have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. Well, you can put Argylle down as another one of his that I liked. There has been a lot of criticism, but I do not fully agree with it.This is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but I will give it a go. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as Argylle. What she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. In comes Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect Elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. While this plot goes on, Elly sees visions of the main character in her book, Argylle (Henry Cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. What I will say is that this film did not market itself well.Audiences see Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. Some viewers will be bothered by this so I thought I would mention it, but the fact is, I love both Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and I thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so I was easily able to forgive that. Where I will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. Once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though I kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.Aside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. With that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as I was being a Matthew Vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. Once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because I like how Vaughn does silly, I was still in for the ride. I also liked the second Kingsman film, so I know this one won't be for everyone. Simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things I enjoyed watching, so I can't be overly harsh here. In my opinion, Argylle is a good time and I recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers."," This Movie is Wild"
"24","Argylle","iamianiman","7/10","31 January 2024","Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.There's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.However, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.Another thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.Its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.While a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn't fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.Even Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. If you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. Her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.There's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.We also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.While the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. It doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not 'wow' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.Verdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. But then, Matthew Vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024."," Fur-tunately, this isn't a Cat-astrophe. It was Purr-fect for a movie released in February."

I liked the aesthetic, visuals, costumes, exceptional acting (especially Emma Stone), the humour and the development of the main character. I must admit that I didn't enjoyed the very explicit sexual scenes, but I didn't mind the concept. It was hard for me to switch my mind from seeing the ""child"" inside her discovering all that sexuality, but I don't know if that's just my social construct of morality that finds it disturbing... if I force myself seeing over my mental barriers, I think I kind of like it. I felt that some scenes were a bit too pornografic for my taste in a movie, and definitely I didn't enjoy watching them in a cinema full of people, it cringes me feeling all those brain's reactions. It's definitely a film that needs to be watched if you've a cinema lover, but I don't judge the public that loved it or hated it, because I can't decide myself.

It is either a large number of erotic shots or the so-called desire, let alone the combination of the sky picture and the so-called anti-paternity idea, or the rise of feminism. In this way It will only look more disgusting and 2B.The three male characters in the film dominate the heroine, but every time the heroine's choice is wrong.Every time she feels that her choice is right, it collapses the next second.Most of the male protagonists in the film reveal greasy, perverted, obscene and obscene psychology, as if in their hearts. Women are their own controls, and they can only be used as their own sexual tools to vent. I know that the director wants. To use the psychology of several men to highlight the personality that the heroine is controlled and cannot find freedom, but this way seems too superficial, and in the end, the way the heroine escapes seems too fake and idealistic.I don't think this is a story about desire. What I saw is a desire director who made a desire story for himself to satisfy his own desire, but I like the strange and extremely absurd style of the film very much.It's a good start. I think the narrative and expression of the story can be more advanced. ! ( PS: There are too many erotic scenes in the whole film! Some are completely unnecessary!

On the other hand, Dorothy did not spend the back half of ""Oz"" having gratuitous sex with the Scarecrow, any of the flying monkeys, or the men of Oz.DaFoe is still the consummate actor, and his portrayal of the gruesomely disfigured ""God""win, a gifted surgeon and educator is well played. His character actually seemed more interesting than Bella.The storyline truly required a sensational level of the suspension of disbelief. Like Oz, where scarecrows, tin men and lions could talk, Godwin used his surgical talents for not evil, as much as for weirdness. The initial observation of a dog with a chicken body and a duck with pigs body portrayed what was to come.The denouement of Bellas originated life leading her to make a terminal choice in the final 20 minutes of the film were more unusual and interesting than not.Overall, I'm glad we fought the urge to walk out after 20 minutes or so.

Which I'm guessing is part of the point. The pros are that it is beautifully shot, with very unique camera perspectives; has some very funny at moments; and the lead character played by Stone is fearless and shows tremendous growth throughout the film. However, it will be hard for many to get past the vulgerness, gratuitous violence and sex, callousness of the characters, and plot points that challenges moral code. While I think the film maker handled many of these concepts brilliantly while managing to successfully express clear messages of despair, hopelessness, and personal growth, the gratuity is pushed in excess to a point where the message becomes muddled in the shock value. A couple sitting next to me in the theater walked out in the first 10 minutes. By the end, I was mesmerized and touched, but I think it could have been trimmed down to be both more tasteful and clearer in its overall message."," A lot to Love, but overly gratuitous"

The screenwriter took the most intriguing part of the book and made a very compelling movie to watch, although they lost the essence of what the book is saying in the end. The visuals alone are worth watching for, but the performances of both Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo are the most delightful, wonderful, funny, engaging acting I've seen in a long time. The movie blew me away, although I will say the amount of explicit sex and nudity was a bit over the top (Bella Baxter is not ashamed of her body or sex, I get it, but I don't need to be hit over the head repeatedly with it to make that point). The commentary on society, and men and women's roles and perception is interesting and poignant, although nothing new. But the approach the filmmakers took to making that commentary definitely is.

This to me is a well thought out movie and this directior is famous for doing thoughtful movies like this. This is the first work of Yorgos Lanthimos I've seen and he's done really cool projects like the Lobster and killing of a sacred deer etc and I can't believe this is his first project I'm seeing and honestly he has an exceptional mind. Poor things is a movie you have to get comfortable with at least you'd have to get comfortable with the black and white era once you can go through that it becomes a more comfortable sailing all through. This to me is a love story on many levels and I'd try my best to express myself here. The protagonist Bella Baxter when introduced is done in a way to make you a little bit uncomfortable kept in a house by someone that could be called a monster but for some reason don't see it (_because children don't see monsters but they see kindness and cruelty and the doctor showed her kindness even though he knew little of it_) the doctor (Godwin Baxter) was a man very brilliant and intelligent but never knew or probably understood why or how his father showed him so much cruelty while his father saw him as an object for experiment he saw Bella as what she is a human who deserved love and gave it to her the best way he could imagine it.(_tho she was an experiment too_) Max Mccandles shows a softer more unconditional love and a lil bit of guilt. He knew Bella was a child and that guilt plagued him he knew that he couldn't trust her with any decision even though she looked like an adult. But why I say or use the word unconditional is because of Duncan Wedderburn who had a possessive love for Bella who liked her for that hint of innocence she had, the kind that made her oblivious of her environment and so she never reads the room. Her love with Toinette is what I'd call friendship love tho they were intimate I still see it as that and mind you this is mostly from a Bella POV the way she views the world her curiosity, gullibility and how people wanted to use her especially when she got to Paris. (_I don't want this to be long cos I have a lot to say but if you've read this long I think this review contains spoilers please forgive me for not indicating it earlier_).

It's a symphony of rebellion, a joyous, raucous middle finger to the suffocating strictures of ""polite society."" This isn't whimsical Frankenstein; it's a scalpel dipped in satire, gleefully dissecting the vile social rules that have become a cage for the human spirit.Imagine, if you will, a world where the shackles of repression are ripped away. Where a mind, liberated from the stifling grip of societal expectations, inhabits an adult body under the full torment of youthful hormonal cocktail . This is Bella, a glorious explosion of uninhibited life. She devours the world with a primal hunger, a whirlwind of sex, laughter, food and dance. Each act of defiance is a vibrant brushstroke on the canvas of her existence, a testament to the power of embracing one's true self, skin and all.""Poor Things"" is a beacon for body positivity and a fierce champion of female agency. Bella, even when she is a Parisian prostitute with a thirst for life, demands a radical shift in power dynamics. What if, she posits, women chose their clients for that furious dance of pleasure? This isn't mere entertainment; it's a revolution brewing in petticoats and laughter.The film doesn't shy away from the raw realities of this rebellion. There's a bittersweet beauty in the way it captures Bella's journey, the yearning for a life unbound from the chains of societal expectations. It forces us to confront the very essence of freedom, the audacious act of simply being oneself in a world that demands conformity.Adapted from Alasdair Gray's novel, yet set in a whimsically anachronistic late-Victorian era, the film crackles with darkly humorous parodies of Romantic melodrama. Its visual distortions and grotesque moments add to the unsettling atmosphere. Yet, at its core, ""Poor Things"" champions uninhibited existence, asking us to question societal norms. The performances, especially Emma Stone's portrayal of Bella's evolution, crackle with intensity. This is a film that will ignite some and unsettle others. For some prudish men and women it will be like molten lead poured through their eyes and ears and such is it's intended intensity.""Poor Things"" is more than entertainment; it's a call to arms. Watch it, and let the fire ignite within you.

Man...I cannot recall seeing a movie where the filmmakers used what could be such off-putting music, but it works here and speaks to the courage of Lanthimos/the producers for trying to serve the story over what might be more appealing.I felt the first half of the movie was really going places, but it lags and goes a bit off down the stretch. That was disappointing to me as it was asking the right questions about life and experience in such a fresh, unique, and funny way, and I was really hoping they would ""bring it home.""

"51","Oppenheimer","Jeremy_Urquhart","7/10","20 July 2023","One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion.

"54","Oppenheimer","MrDHWong","9/10","20 July 2023","""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10."," A brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws"

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

"56","Oppenheimer","Geekofriendly","9/10","26 July 2023","I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb."," Nolan touches greatness, falls slightly short"
"57","Oppenheimer","mark-217-307033","9/10","19 July 2023","I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end."," And the Oscar goes to..."

"61","Oppenheimer","timmyhollywood","5/10","23 July 2023","Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10."," Breaks all filmmaklng rules, but not in a good way"
"62","Oppenheimer","Dvir971","10/10","19 July 2023","Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig G√∂ransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

"63","Oppenheimer","EShy","3/10","25 July 2023","I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing."," This just might be as interesting as this topic can get"
"64","Oppenheimer","heykateforever","9/10","17 February 2024","I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

"65","Oppenheimer","TheBigSick","4/10","28 July 2023","0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout.

"67","Oppenheimer","zeki-4","3/10","20 July 2023","Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so."," This movie is the bomb!"
"68","Oppenheimer","leestoych","10/10","22 July 2023","At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig G√∂ransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10."," Technically superb but..."

Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet."," Stunning - put it in a time capsule"
"74","Oppenheimer","GoatOfNeptune","1/10","22 July 2023","Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia."," Half an Hour too long, misses the point"
"75","Oppenheimer","aharmas","3/10","22 July 2023","It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles. Remember not all that shines is gold."," Disappointing"
"76","Oppenheimer","mrmenachristian","5/10","3 December 2023","I discovered this film to be excessively intricate, unnecessarily lengthy, and somewhat challenging to sit through. The acting, notably from Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy, is commendable, however, the relentless and simplistic portrayal of the American perspective becomes rather wearisome. Moreover, it missed a chance to delve deeper into illustrating the profound impact of the bomb on Japan.Not sure why this movie is/was shown at IMAX but I'm glad I watched it at home over two days because I almost fell asleep twice.This movie is an hour too long and probably one of Christopher Nolan's worst films."," Great acting but challenging to sit through"

I felt that I did not get out of the movie knowing Oppenheimer more.It's true that the explosion scene was a master class but again Nolan has all the means to unleash some quality scene like these. Action and technical scenes are nothing fancy for him !Gary Oldman ; LEGENDARY in very few shots.Clearly, the means were there, the story, the cast but the mixture was overdone ...I cannot help but say that there were better biopics ; a beautiful mind, the theory of everything, ... this one not that crazy.The SCORE was forgettable ... very much so !"," Not better than Tenet ; Honestly"

The director of oppenheimer is not so good, so I was expecting nothing more than a fictional grade 5 movie. The movie is boring, confusing but at least show that americans cant trust even in their own scientists, they made a witch hunt for the ones that they considered a menace for the nation, some questions werent answered, important questions as what hapenned to oppenheimer? Did he stay working for the government, was he tempted to change sides after seeing that the government didnt trust him? What happened to the city near the tests place?"," Completly fictional movie"

On a level, I am not sure if it was less annoying than a young children shouting the same random nonsense mixed goat sounds and farting in a vertical video.Plus point for the fine ladies in incomplete cloting.I hope at least the Barbie movie is better."," How could they TikTokify my Oppenheimer?"
"80","Oppenheimer","SnappyBuddha","5/10","17 August 2023","The movie's main issue is that it didn't need to be so complicated. Movies can be engaging without being confusing, like ""The Godfather,"" ""Shawshank Redemption,"" or ""Million Dollar Baby."" Another problem is that the movie drags on because it's too long and some parts feel slow.I was expecting a movie about an atomic bomb and science, but there's hardly any science in it, well that is an individual perspective. They only show the explosion briefly, and then the movie focuses on something else.Then they tried to make Oppenheimer a hero, but if you think about it, he wasn't perfect. He cheated on his partner, had affairs, and had connections with communists, even helping them. Considering the time and the situation in the US back then, he could easily have looked suspicious. They could have focused more on the science and used good effects like in ""Interstellar,"" which in itself is a good combination.The only good thing about the movie is the actors. All of them did a great job, which is a positive aspect. This is the first time I'm so disappointed with a movie from Christopher Nolan."," I am a Nolan fan but ....."
"81","Oppenheimer","fltola","4/10","19 February 2024","I had high expectations based on Nolan's other superior films. The acting in OPPENHEIMER is top-notch. Unfortunately, it isn't enough to save the 'plot,' unnecessarily chock-full of overused, fast-paced, disjointed scenes. A good portion of the time I couldn't figure out what the heck was going on or who the people were. As for the rest, I felt as if I was at a boring legislative hearing. Ultimately, the viewer never really gets to know what made these people tick. Instead, we are overfed a repetitive technique as off-putting as the dominating fragrance of countless roses surrounding a funereal corpse--a few can be uplifting, a thousand pure hell.

"82","Oppenheimer","sasquatch-89510","3/10","1 January 2024","I held off seeing this movie until it was available to buy on Prime, and I don't think I've ever been more underwhelmed by a film relative to the hype. The scenes were cut in a very confusing way, there was a loud annoying stomping soundtrack that appeared in scenes that didn't need it, and the plot focused on some of the less interesting aspects of the Manhattan project. Why spend so much on a hollywood blockbuster and focus the plot around the security clearance and idiosyncrasies of one person and retrodding on themes about nuclear weapons that we've heard for decades in countless other films? I've studied WWII for years and feel fairly educated in the manhatten project, and I found the plot found the most boring way possible to portray the period, the project and the people involved.And then there's the...explosion. So much hype about the explosion scene and how CGI wasn't used, and it showed. Anyone can go on youtube and see the trinity blast and dozens of other nuclear blasts, and the one shown in this film did NOT look like a nuclear blast. It looked like a slow motion close-up of a gas can exploding."," Super underwhelming"

However the second Leg of the film is quite boring and pretty uninteresting. I would probably class the film in the lower end of nolan's films. The acting is however great, performances were probably some of the best. I've seen this year. Certain scenes that have been mentioned a lot in the media, I do agree are not necessary and had no impact on my experience of the film and it did feel out of place.

It's worth seeing, to be sure, but I think it's one of those overhyped productions that will be lost in the dusty film archive where pomposity goes to die.The sound level, which the theater insists was set according to strict instructions from the studio, was abusively loud.

But out of no where the fox girl (Zhen) just appeared, telling Po about a random malevolent sorcerer that want to take over the world, and Po just, go and be the hero again? We saw Tai Lung, Kai, and Shen, they all had a connection to the main characters. And there's this Chameleon, not a single connection to Po or any other individuals that we already knew, and Po just... be the hero and go on fighting that girl? It was TOO rushed, it felt weird.Secondly, i feel like the moral lesson and the story was not handled well. How could Po realize that he had to change his mindset by just, fighting a shapeshifting sorcerer, and just somehow chose Zhen to be the successor? I really had a lot of expectation for the potentials of the shapeshifting power. But instead, i got rip-off versions of the Kung fu masters, and a... dragon? Like you literally can absorb powers and transform different parts of your body, and she chose to be a dragon and just flying around? That was literally so stupid and absurd, how can you even think of taking the world when you can't even use your powers right? And then Zhen somehow could use the spiritual power, and boom, she was chosen to be the successor, after her betrayal and stuffs?

"106","Kung Fu Panda 4","csxtnf","6/10","8 March 2024","I've been a fan of this franchise for a very long time and what I've got to say for the 4th movie it's not that bad it's still a good movie even with its flaws, I do like the idea of Po becoming a spiritual leader and trying to find the next dragon warrior, in my opinion I think this is a good start for this new trilogy I don't think it's a cash grabbed because they have already been planning 6 Kung fu panda movies here are my pros and cons for this 4th installmentProsThe idea of bringing past villains back especially Tai Lung, Lord Shen and General Kai is a good idea.In my opinion I think the chameleon is a better villain than Kai and Viola Davis played the chameleon so perfectly.At first I was worried but I think Awkwafina done so much better for this role as Zhen I also like the backstory they gave zhen.I'm so glad they brought tai lung back and finally gave him a redemption arc even though I kinda wish we have more for his redemption but I think it's good the way it is and I like the fact that he respected and bow to po at the end.The fight scenes were awesome they were short but awesome and an improvement.Po's dads have a bigger role in this film and I think they were really funny and great in this film.The animation was really good even though I would have preferred the realistic animation but the animation is still good and its really amazing in some scenes.I don't think the soundtrack was that bad as people say I personally like it especially at the end credit scene when jack black sings Baby one more time.ConsI am glad they brought back Shen and Kai but they play a very small role like a 30 second cameo and they don't have any lines at all it sucks that they didn't bring back the voice actors.I wish they gave more dept for The Chameleon all their really was is that they didn't accept her to learn Kung fu because she was small so she gave up that path to learn how to become a sorcerer.The furious five only makes a cameo, in the beginning po explains that their off to an adventure on their own then they appear at the end of the credits training with Zhen.I would like to point out of how Kai is somehow brought back, in the 3rd film he exploded for taking to much chi in the spirit realm and shouldn't he not really exit no more? I wish they could have explained how he came back.I do like the ending but it doesn't make sense, so not only tai lung bowed and respect po but also Kai and shen and other master bowed and respected po I also wish they would have explain why Kai and shen bowed and respect po, Maybe because po saved them and got their Kung fu back? Probably but i wish they could have gotten more into detail of why Kai and shen have respect for po now.Those were my pros and cons so I don't think this movie was bad I think it's still good and a good way to start this new trilogy so I'm giving this 4th film a 7.5/10."," It's not that bad it's still a good movie"
"107","Kung Fu Panda 4","icebearreadytobouce","8/10","9 March 2024","And I thought the third movie was the best out of the whole franchise BUT NO. This one definitely took over.Ik so many people may see it as a cash grab, but I don't. You see, even if it was a cash grab, I could never agree to think it was lazily made, because it was NOT. As a young artist myself, this movie was more than the fourth movie in the franchise, it was for the fans, made with so much love and care with lots of hardwork. This movie was not so easy to make, and so what I'm saying is that we should appreciate animators, storytellers and musicians even more than we do, because without the art majoring students, there wouldn't be any creativity or something that reunites us for laughs and good times. Certainly a movie worth watching."," I literally was overwhelmed"
"108","Kung Fu Panda 4","lulwal-30138","10/10","8 March 2024","I read everyone's reviews before watching kfp 4 which made my hopes drop dead. But it's actually amazing! I don't get why people didn't like it, they're probably the ones who aren't truly attached to kung fu panda. Anyway:the movie was fast ngl, they should have reduced the time of the fights in the beginning so other important scenes can be a bit longer.I have no idea why they didn't bring the old voice actors into the act. Kai and Lord Shen's voice actors. I mean it would have been nice to see them interact with Po like Tai Lung did.I would've preferred Tigress to be the new Dragon Warrior, but at least we got to see her in the end YAYYAY. Same thing about the voice actors. I would have loved to hear a small interaction between Zhen and the five.Other than that, THE MOVIE WAS PERFECTLY MADE!The animation is killer, the plot is amazing. I don't like the fact Po isn't the dragon warrior anymore, and Shifu's behaviour was kinda off, but I still adored it."," IT'S GOOD!"
"109","Kung Fu Panda 4","dewainkarnes","7/10","10 March 2024","Watched it at AMC theaters 3 different times in less than 24 hours 3D was great, Dolby surround sound was even better and then probably the most disappointing was in laser projection but was still worth it. I would give it a 10/10 also check different theaters have different collectibles for the movie. Definitely can't wait for Kung Fu Panda 5 which if it follows the timeline as the other films it will be out in 2 years but we will see definitely leaves a cliff hanger at the end so you are eager to see which way the next movie will go, I see a lot of negative reviews for some reason most saying no Furious 5 but isn't true because they're exploring missions although we don't see them until the end of the movie they're still in it, some people are saying low budget film and rushed but I think maybe it seems rushed because if at any point you stop paying attention you are behind trying to figure out the story plots, some are saying that they wanted a better fight at the end but they aren't realizing that Zhen and Po both took aim at the villain so don't let the 1 and 2 star reviews ruin the opportunity to see the movie and keep you in suspense for the next one."," Cliff hanging ending"
"110","Kung Fu Panda 4","malekalnajafi","9/10","10 March 2024","Just watched Kung Fu panda 4.And what can I say except I'm disappointed. It's the worst out of the franchise. It's feels like an episode like the villain got all the villains powers then she dies from 2 flicks from the staff that Po is using. And then all the villains bow to po at the end. So dumb.And why is Po picking a new dragon warrior when the dragon warrior prophecy has been a 200 year old prophecy.2nd of all oogway picked Po because he resembles the yin and yang this fox is so random. Like all the villans in the kung Fu panda are cool and all have a motive. Tai lung was lied to and wanted to be the dragon warrior. Lord shen wanted to rule all of China and sad origin story of Po past and general kai felt betrayed by oogway and wanted revenge and no one knew his name, even though general kai treated him as a brother also awesome theme andnow chameleon idk what she wants but it sounds like she wants to rule all of China like Lord Chen.I also felt like Kung Fu panda 4 was a cheap rip off of kung Fu panda 2 of how they explore different parts of China and Both the chameleon and lord Chen have the same motivesOverall 7/10 being niceI'm not saying it's a bad movie but all Kung Fu panda movies were a masterpiece so this was VERY disappointing."," Meh üòï 7/10"
"111","Kung Fu Panda 4","GalaxyGuy686","10/10","11 March 2024","First of all it sad to say that the Furious Five were only in the last bit of the movie, but the animation was top notch. I also liked how they bringed back all the villians from the previous movies. This is definitely another awesome movie that DreamWorks has put out. It was fun to see all the battles and the dads come together. I liked the new dragon warrior and the movie directors definitely put a lot of thought in to that character. I hope to see another one of these to see where the new dragon warrior and I would like to see more Furious Five, but other than that it was great. Thank you for your time. :)"," Dime"
"112","Kung Fu Panda 4","ruzaam","10/10","11 March 2024","People have to understand the fact that is movie was an absolute masterpiece. If they watch the movie without any expectation from the previous trilogy, the movie would provide the top of line animation and lighting while also having a totally superb story. Hence I would recommend any kung fu panda fans (like me) to re-watch or watch the movie with 0 expectations.Now I would be coming to the disappointment from the past 3 movies. Would still have to agree on the fact that Kai and Shen were absolutely misused. The Chameleon was a very weak villain with not a strong motive to conquer China unlike previously Shen. A high opportunity of the usage of the characters from the spirit realm was absolutely missed, like why would you tease Tai Lung in the trailer to create hype just for him to sit in a cage the while movie and then bow to Po at the end and mean same for all villains (e.g. Kai, Shen) that they didn't had one line in the movie and sat in cage while bowing to Po at the end. The fight between Chameleon and Po was too short.But I didn't quite found the movie to be rushed in any sense and it was pretty relaxing. I have no probs with Awkwafina being Zhen. Found the Animation, Story(except for a few blunders) and concept of continuing of the dragon warrior quite nice, well finished, beautiful and eloquent. TBH I also want Kung fu Panda 5 to also come out as a Sequel with Focus on Po with more attention given to the next instalment, I am sure it will be a very huge success.I am rating it a 10 just because people are not passing on their honest rating, they just have included their bias from the previous movies. My actual rating would actually be 8.7/10."," Pretty Nice"
"113","Kung Fu Panda 4","ffddmm","2/10","9 March 2024","The movie was really good in my opinion and sure it is not as good as the other Kung Fu Panda movies but it is still good but what i don't understand is that people saying that this movie is really bad and i see people rating it 3/10, 5/10, 4/10. It is not a bad movie wth? It is worth the watch and I think it's because the new characters maybe but the Chameleon was a good villain but it is not the best villain. It's worth the watch and I think more people should apperciate this movie in my opinion. I get that maybe people think this is a cash grab movie but i didn't expect there's alot of people that think this movie is a cash grab."," Wth are the reviews?"
"114","Kung Fu Panda 4","usmansafi-25475","10/10","14 March 2024","""Where to even begin with this cinematic disaster? 'Unnecessary Chronicles' delivers a mind-numbing experience from start to finish, leaving audiences questioning why it was ever greenlit in the first place. With a plot thinner than a sheet of paper and characters as compelling as cardboard cutouts, this film manages to squander every ounce of potential it might have had.The acting is so wooden that it's a wonder the cast didn't catch termites. Dialogue exchanges are cringeworthy, resembling poorly written soap opera scripts from the '80s. Not to mention the egregious overuse of clich√©s that would make even the most forgiving viewer roll their eyes in disbelief.As if the lackluster storyline wasn't enough, the film's pacing is akin to watching paint dry on a rainy day. Scenes drag on for what feels like an eternity, leaving audiences desperately yearning for the end credits to roll and put them out of their misery.Even the production value falls flat, with laughably cheap special effects that wouldn't pass muster in a high school student film project. It's as if the filmmakers raided a bargain bin for their visual effects budget and called it a day.In the end, 'Unnecessary Chronicles' is an insult to the art of filmmaking and a waste of precious time and resources.

"116","Kung Fu Panda 4","raeleegriffin","8/10","15 March 2024","Overall the film was very watchable and entertaining. The animation is good, the comedy is okay as well as the plot, and the fight scenes are great.I throughly enjoyed the rooftop fight scene when Awkafina's character turns out to be a ghost and posseses Po to win the fight. I also liked the conversation between Po and Tai Lung, when they talk about how much they both enjoy turtle soup, and then Oogway shows behind them. I loved the three evil bunnies, my favorite line of the movie actually comes from them, when the white one tells Po ""To be an arsonist, one must let go of their inner water. Urinate, Po, and be free."" Very inspirational and deep for a children's film.I enjoyed Po's dads, they were halarious and them fighting over who got to pack Po's lunch added some of the best jokes to the movie.My only complaint is that the conclusion felt very sudden and force. Po and the Chameleon getting together seemed a bit rushed, though I'll admit they had some good chemistry, just not enough of it. And the Chameleon's redemption arc just came too fast in my opinion.Overall, I do recommend it. It's a good watch if you just want some laughs, and it's plenty appropriate for kids, unless you consider the kissing scene at the end to be too much for a kids movie."," Good movie, but with an odd conclusion"
"117","Kung Fu Panda 4","zacmiddup","8/10","15 March 2024","They made the biggest mistake hiring Mike Mitchell as the director, he didn't want to show Tai lung and Shifu reunite and that was an important part of Tai lungs character and his character was literally connected to Shifu and he just ignored that and the movie also felt rushed, the chameleon was a weak villain she could have been written way better. They should have had Stephanie Ma Stine as the director she had good ideas for this movie but Mike Mitchell refused them, he really needed to be fired and let Stephanie take over as the director, she would have saved this movie. I really wish this movie was good because I've been a huge fan of the Kung Fu panda movies."," Such a disappointing movie"
"118","Kung Fu Panda 4","creationdev-12043",NA,"11 March 2024","I watched it in theater and, it's not bad but it's not too good either. The film had some fantastic visual with a surprisingly lower budget of $85 million compared to previous 3 installment where it exceeded $120 million, the voice performance was good, overall they did pretty well with the animation and stuff.However, let's talk about the plot. The plot is just, rushed. There have been several DreamWorks film with a rushed plot (Though some of them ended up being a good film) and this one has to be one of 'em. Fight scene lasted quite short, it's just all about Chameleon using her powers with the Kung Fu skills she has stolen from several masters and Po using mostly some of his Kung Fu skill with the Staff of Wisdom along with Zhen, that's it. The plot isn't as fun as the previous 3 installment in the franchise but still quite fun to me, just not as fun as the last one. It just lacks emotional depth, charm, etc. Basically, the plot is fine but it wasn't as good as the last 3 installment.So, in conclusion, while it's not a bad film, it mostly has quite a problem with the plot and writing."," Not bad, I guess"
"119","Kung Fu Panda 4","colethecook",NA,"13 March 2024","Kung Fu Panda 4"" boasts exceptional visuals, demonstrating remarkable advancements in animation with vibrant colors and intricate details. However, the film falls short in several key areas. The voice acting lacks the depth and nuance of previous installments, detracting from the overall experience. Moreover, the storyline is highly predictable, lacking the innovative twists fans have come to expect from the franchise. Disappointingly, it also omits the crucial development of Po becoming a 'spiritual leader,' a significant narrative arc anticipated by many. Despite the stunning picture quality, these shortcomings render ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" a rather forgettable chapter in the series. Its failure to deliver on both character development and plot innovation makes watching it feel like a missed opportunity and, frankly, a waste of time for loyal fans and newcomers alike."," Thirst for Effort"
"120","Kung Fu Panda 4","garciaisidro-13713",NA,"10 March 2024","Embracing change is the message for this movie. I really enjoyed how Po tried to avoid the next step in his journey, and in doing so he makes a big mistake. Echoing Oogway's words, ""One often meets his destiny trying to avoid it"". By the end of the movie, he naturally begins to accept his new role as Oogway's successor. As for Zhen, I didn't know how I would feel about her before watching the movie. Now, I can say that I like how they did her character. She had a better bond with Po than I had anticipated; making her betrayal actually matter. Mr. Ping and Li delivered when it came to laughs, enhancing the movie experience. The action scenes in this one are some of the best in this series, and of all animated movies. I really liked the camera work for the finale fight of this film. I generally believe that due to people's disappointment (lack of Furious Five or villain usage) they paint the film as terrible, which it is not, it is definitely above average and better than the third film. If I were to choose between Chameleon or General Kai, I would choose Chameleon. I say this because Kai is not taken as a serious threat and is played more for comedy, whereas in the first two movies: Tai Lung and Shen are balanced between comedy and serious moments. Chameleon, besides one unfunny scene is played more serious than comedic. Although she lacks a compelling reason for doing what she does; I liked how she mirrors Po, in the sense that they were both underestimated and that they proved everyone else wrong. I hear people accuse this of a cashgrab when all movies are made for making money, whether good or bad. Anyway, go watch the movie it is definitely a good watch."," Awesome!!!"
"121","Kung Fu Panda 4","LindsieMightBePicky",NA,"10 March 2024","This film had the smallest budget and main cast out of the entire franchise. You can tell production had plans to meet everyone's expectation. You can tell they really wanted their big End Game moment, with Poe finally resolving his issues with his past enemies, as well as with the other upcoming changes addressed in the film. They did the best with what they got, and I really appreciate the crew for giving their best efforts! They clearly weren't given the budget to pull off such a cool concept. You have to have more than 85 Million to bring in big names like Jack Black, Awkwafina, Viola Davis, Bryan Cranston, as well as Gary Oldman and JK Simmons. It's not like the limitations they faced weren't obvious.This film was most likely affected by the strike. It was either rushed or delayed by the company, as you can tell by some of the recycled animation concepts. If it wasn't the strike, it was definitely The Wild Robot. You can tell what production Dreamwork's really cared about and it wasn't Kung Fu Panda 4, that Chicken Run sequel, or Megamind 2. Even though the project was rushed, the story is entertaining. I have a habit of guessing the plot of films, and guessed the plot of this film two minutes in. Still, the show tackles concepts both adults and children can relate to. Honestly, the animation of this film is so beautiful. If you didn't feel completely immersed by those gorgeous landscape shots, you went into this film already expecting it to fail.Unfortunately, Dreamwork's is slowly losing itself by following in the same pitfalls as Disney. This is basically their Strange World. It had little marketing, and I'm sure was just meant to bring in some spring break money. It's great to have groundbreaking concepts like The Wild Robot come to life, but that doesn't mean your other films should suffer. Why put all your budget into one major blockbuster when you could even the playing field and have 2-3 big hits?"," All Things Considered, People are Being a Little Harsh"
"122","Kung Fu Panda 4","dvdhnze",NA,"9 March 2024","If we evaluate the film on its own, it is good, but if we compare it with the first three films, the film is bad because of the 8-year wait and the expectations they raised even higher in the trailer. I was waiting for his showdown with Tai lung to end and it did. It has not lost anything from its comedy. I think the return of the legendary five to the palace at the end of the film is a sign that they will be in the next film. It was an average film compared to the first three films. I also felt that there were deficiencies in the film. It was not as full as the other films. Both the new character and the chameleon were not handled well enough. Especially the chameleon. I hope the 5th and 6th films will not be so boring and incomplete and they will not ruin the beautiful film."," Bad compared to the first three series."
"123","Kung Fu Panda 4","gerasimosxanthis",NA,"8 March 2024","The 4th instalment of the KFP franchise has finally arrived and I have to say, It was fine.Jack Black has returned to voice Po the Giant Panda AKA the Dragon Warrior about to be promoted to Spiritual Leader and is on a mission to find a successor for the role of the Dragon Warrior while a powerful sorceress, the Chameleon, is about to interrupt him...Let's talk about the Positive things about the movie: The story is a massive improvement from the 3rd movie, with some character development with our new secondary protagonist, Awkawina Fox Zhen.Also we have some Worldbuilding, at least when Po and Zhen arrive in the city. As for the animation, they are very improved since the last movie (despite the lower budget this time)SO, Let's talk about Zhen and the big baddie, the Chameleon: Zhen is voiced by Awkwafina, a slightly controversial actress, and she is suprisingly good in this role, not gonna lie. She is not as annoying as I thought she would be and one moment in the climax was a bit sweet.The Chameleon on the other hand, (voiced by the Oscar awarded Viola Davis, who also portayed Amanda Waller in the Suicide Squad movies) was an interesting antagonist. Her goal was to summon and steal the powers and Kung Fu skills of every dead master, including the 3 villains from the previous movies Tai Lung, Lord Shen and General Kai (with the later two being nonsesical, as Lord Shen is not a Kung Fu Master and Kai's Spirit was destroyed in the 3rd movie). The Chameleon DOESN'T have a backstory, other than that she was rejected from being taught Kung Fu because of her small size (despite Mantis existing), but other than that, she is a fine villain.Also Tai Lung had a great fight scene before being caged by the Chameleon.Let's talk about the Negatives: The Furious Five are just cameos in the end credits with no voice lines. Lord Shen and General Kai have no voice lines and only appear for a minute, before being sent back to the Spirit Realm and Tai Lung's Redemption Arc was just ""You defeated the Chameleon, now I am grateful and maybe Oogway was right""Overall, the movie was alright, but nothing beats the first and second."," Kung Fu Mediocracy; 8 Years in the making"
"124","Kung Fu Panda 4","H_NU11",NA,"10 March 2024","This was a great addition to the series, don't listen to anyone calling it a money grab. The story was at least as good as any of the other ones the animation was good and the voice acting was great. And there were no annoying slow parts, it was a great movie, we enjoyed it thoroughly. If you get a chance to see it in 3D, it's worth it I think that made it even better. It's also about the right length for this type of movie, anything longer is tough to get through with children, anything shorter feels too short. I would recommend this to anyone with kids or anyone that was a fan of any of the other movies."," Great addition to the series"
"125","Kung Fu Panda 4","cartoonism",NA,"8 March 2024","Let's cut to the point. The animation is gorgeous and more fluid, offering a visually stunning experience. It boasts more details, resulting in a more realistic texture and a more vibrant color palette. The visuals are on par with KFP3, albeit with a distinct and generic tone but it surprisingly works. Po's visuals also have been re-rendered, combining elements from KFP2 and 3, which is a surprising and delightful aspect. The camera movements and transitions enhance the viewing experience and the impression of the choreography.The writing is quite good, with a well-paced narrative. Before you think movie is just merely cash-grab, Kung Fu Panda 4 is crucial for Po's next development. Po has taken over from Oogway and is expected to become a spiritual leader according to Shifu. However, his Kung Fu skill development is faster than his wisdom, which makes his age seem kinda inappropriate. Therefore, this movie explores how he gains wisdom, and it is well-written. The way they treated all the characters in this film is commendable, especially Po, who did not suffer from regression, and Zhen, who did not overshadow Po. Everything is well-balanced.The villain is menacing, as is typical of KFP villains, but her backstory and motives lack depth. The reappearance of previous villains is merely a gimmick, which is not well-executed and somewhat disappointing. Tai Lung is the only one who played a bit significant role, given the length of the animated film. The Chameleon lacks a climactic defeat, and somewhat lackluster in the end. However, the other fight scenes are still impressive. The abcent of the Furious Five is also not a very good decision to make.The comedy and humor are at their peak, with the whole audience in my theater's studio are laughing out loud. Po's father duo is particularly funny. There are also dark moments, but the most touching moment for me was when Zhen hugged Po. As usual, there are wise and philosophical moments from Shifu, Mr. Ping, and Po himself, conveying moral messages. The quote ""Every pit holds a strength of a mighty tree"" is particularly my favorite. The scoring is not as impressive as I had hoped (I was expecting it to be high like KFP3), but it is still has a good charm, and there are many memorable themes, including some old leitmotifs. Hans Zimmer did it again, despite being busy with Dune: Part Two. Jack Black's cover song,"" ""Hit Me Baby One More Time,"" literally hit so hard. The music scores are definitely exceptional, although not the best.Kung Fu Panda 4 meets every expectation of a KFP movie. It may not be the best and maybe the weakest out of the franchise but it still has a potential. Overall it's a pretty light and entertaining movie. I recommend everyone to watch it."," Another great addition to the franchise!"

What this movie, which I've seen multiple times, succeeds in doing, is manifest the spirit of this incredibly thought out universe. It also succeeds in other respects, but I'll leave that aside.It is interesting that the latest version, not a bad film at all, is almost a storyboard replica of the first. But all it adds is a bit of computer polish, and lacks the eerie ambiance that was so poignantly enhanced by the first's soundtrack.Folks love hating on this. Folks be folks.

"127","Kung Fu Panda 4","Starbuck-13","9/10","15 April 1999","To begin with, I have to say that I saw the movie first, and read the book years later. This seems to be important: Nearly everybody who read the book first hates the movie, but most of those who saw the movie first seem to like it.Now, why is this so? I cannot really understand it because, in comparition to other movies based on existing literature, what we have here is a film which stays very close to the original story and does not add many new elements.When I read the book, I could see the movie in front of me in nearly every chapter. So I really don't understand what Herbert-Fans had expected from this movie...I for my part like it a lot. It has a very mystical atmosphere about it and the story develops nicely. Of course there are some elements which are simply not explained and are therefore very confusing, but somehow this seems to be a thing Lynch tends to do in every of his movies, so what? I like some simple scenes like the opening monologue a whole lot. I LOVE the music (which played in my mind all the time while I read the book), and I think the characters are very strong and (for example Letho Atreides) sometimes full of tragedy.The part I like the most though is the worm-part. I think the special effects are not always brilliant, but seeing the scenes with the worms, I am really awestruck because they are so impressing.All in all, I think this is one of the more underrated movies in Science Fiction history. It may be because the director himself was not happy with it, or because fans expected too much from a simple two hour movie. I always enjoy watching this film and listening to the soundtrack. And I would love to see a Director's Cut version."," Why does Lynch hate this one?"

In hindsight, the 80s movie REALLY captured the dark, dirty dealings of all the factions. EXCEPT the prominent role of the Bene Gesserit...They are the central faction in all the books (in my opinion). In that sense, Lynch focussed on the world-building too much (Can't help thinking today it would be No.1 of 3 or 4 movies) Maybe that was his intention?Don't get me wrong, I loved the AI spectacle of the 2021 version...but it lacked something intangible. It seemed the story-telling played second fiddle to the AI gorgeousness. Plus, Paul Atreides is too young in the 2021 version.Im always disappointed with Hollywood's fascination with teeny actors taking on roles for 20-somethings. A bit like He-Man or She-Ra...seen my nieces and nephews watching a new animated series recently...both characters were about 12/13 years old! Far too young/shiny/peppy for what are roles for adults.

This was a very short cut of it, a disaster made by LaurentisEither way I love LYNCH and I think it is a really incredible cinematic experience, even it has been cut of a film of 8 hours.To tell the universe of Frank Herbert's novel takes time, takes imagination and the creativity of a prodigious mind he has. It is terrible for me being a fan of him anf not watching the real cut. But I hope David, some day it will come to us. This ""trailer"" Of Laurentis is absorbing and I am mad at the same time. But don't understand why he is so furious about that Laurentis cut, he is very intelligent, and he should try to present his real cut. It should be watched in cinemas, 8 hours, in 4k. Ihope one day we could have the option, if it is not in cinema because it's timing well in TV. But yeah in 4k. I don't know if we are waiting to LYNCH decides to see the real cut. It is a pitty, and I don't either know if it exist or not.I saw this film when I was 6 I didn't understand it, because there is too much cutting. But I really love that one, waiting to see the original one day. Know, we have to wait and watch this cinematic experience of art in sci- fi.Till that, I gave it 9 stars out of 10."," Wow!

"130","Kung Fu Panda 4","talonjensen","9/10","18 March 2023","I thought I would write this now that a new Dune movie has finally been made.FYI, I first read the book when I was about 10 years old and I really liked it. I read the book again when I was 60+ and while I still like it, it isn't as good as I remember.In my opinion the 1984 movie is better, so far. The 2nd part of the new Dune movie hasn't come out yet, so it is still possible the new one will be better. The new movie has nice cinematography but is lacking in character development. I am also disappointed by the exclusion of Shadout Mapes, she is an impressive part of the 1984 movie. The new movie is basically background with most of the interesting things coming in the 2nd movie.I really enjoyed the 1984 movie, but I did have friends who couldn't understand it. I assume that is because they were not into SciFi or didn't read the book first. Books are almost always better than movies, so my mind may have automatically filled in what was missing in the movie. But, the movie did have some things that weren't in the book, such as Paul's ability to use his voice as a weapon without the Weirding Module at the end of his fight with Sting which I thought was a nice touch.Overall I really think the 1984 movie was quite good and did a good job of representing the movie. Although, I do wonder if I would think it was so good if I hadn't read the book before watching the movie. At the time it came out several of my friends thought it was difficult to follow which may explain why it wasn't a commercial success."," So far (2023) still the best Dune movie!"
"131","Kung Fu Panda 4","Oceans17","9/10","23 July 2007","Lynch's creative imagination gives a film with a high rate of intense images per square inch of celluloid, beginning with two consecutive solemn scenes: a brief introduction with an impressive Virgina Madsen as Princess Irulan and narrator of what we are about to see, and the vision of a desert where the wind blows with an epic music.Intensity does not decay, as we found ourselves in an operatic exaggeratedly luxurious palace, the center of an already decadent empire, where very fine actors like Jos√© Ferrer and Si√¢n Philips are dressed in spectacular dresses and matching wits with an octopus-like space- time navigator (and all that in less than a few minutes, compressing many pages of Frank Herbert's book).If that's not original enough for you, perhaps you should wait until a giant worm that causes mega-volts of static in the desert sand swallows a huge harvesting machine, or until you see a long row of men on the dunes waiting for an even greater worm and an aspiring messiah to confirm a prophecy in a mysterious death-defying ritual.If you think that stories are excuses to create powerful images, specially in a widescreen, that long row of men standing in the desert (while Paul walks towards his dangerous future) should not disappoint you, even if you are not a fan of Frank Herbert (I am not). As an image, it is one of the most powerful and cinematographically beautiful that I have seen. Lynch is to be credited for such a vision.Plus an endless list of top quality actors like Francesca Annis, Max Von Sydow, Linda Hunt or Dean Stockwell to name a few, wonderful characterizations (Jurgen Prochnow is just the right actor for Duke Leto Atreides, or Lynchian Everett McGill for Stilgar) and of course Kyle MacLachlan as the charismatic heir that becomes hard-boiled leader.9 out of 10 for a film with enough ideas and emotions to fill many films.

It was visually stunning, impactful, true to the novel, and directed by a genius. I feel that it was huge for Dune fans and non Dune fans.The amount of bile directed at this movie should be ignored.

I don't get it, that people say this.The movie is visually strong, the plot is strong (of course; being a close adaption of Frank Herbert's masterpiece), it has (mostly) great performances (Kenneth McMillan as the baron Harkonnen, for instance) and the music (by Toto) is also top notch.I think maybe why people dislike Dune is that they don't understand what kind of movie they are seeing: It is not action, not space opera, it is not drama and it is (in some ways) not a ""typical"" David Lynch movie. The story is very strong, has some heavy implications when it comes to humanity and maybe identity, and tries to do something that seldom is done on film. (In my opinion.) This is science fiction as it is supposed to be.I won't say too much. (Probably someone else has said what I wanted to before me.) My advice: Go see the movie and do not expect Star Wars, and do not expect Blue Velvet. Feel the movie instead of comparing it to some other flick.I gave it 9 out of 10, which i rarely do. I will see this movie over again right away; there is so much to absorb in one watch."," Excellent adaption of Herbert's Dune."

"137","Kung Fu Panda 4","lostonthehighway","9/10","26 March 2021","I have read Frank Herbert's incredible novel twice, which I think is my favourite book of all time, and I went into this with mixed expectations after seeing it hailed as Lynch's only failure. However, I just don't understand all of the criticism.I liked it. That is the first and foremost point I would like to make. I'm well aware that Lynch took considerable creative liberties whilst making this, but I think that the film still had the feel and style of the book. David Lynch's gritty, textured science fiction world meshes perfectly with Dune's unique atmosphere.Of course some plot lines were cut: you have almost 600 pages of material here. I was never expecting everything from the novel to make it onto the screen. However, I think that there was a pretty well-done transition between the book and this - the movie felt similar to what I envisioned it to be in my head as I as reading. It would have been even better if Lynch was allowed to make a trilogy, or even just two films, as that would convey Dune in its entirety. It really is frustrating, because such an ambitious and possibly incredible vision was just messed with in the hands of the studio.I mean, I read the book before watching it, so I didn't really have any problems following along. However, I totally understand why people didn't get it - Dune is a colossal epic and this film only really scratches the surface. So I definitely recommend first giving the book a thorough read beforehand so you have the best experience.Now for the thing that stood out to me the most whilst watching Dune: the effects. The number one problem directors encountered in the 1970s and 1980s is the lack of technology needed to create sci-fi environments such as the once in Dune. However, this is so perfectly achieved here that I was completely blown away. I mean, I'm not saying that the effects were completely flawless, there were a few sliiiightly questionable moments, but for the most part - especially the sandworms - were incredibly done. Some of the effect haven't aged that well, but Dune is a perfect example of an old science-fiction film that poured heart and soul into the effects. Not to sound annoying, but something really isn't the same about modern CGI as opposed to the intricate hand-made miniatures. This film, as well as 1982's Blade Runner, redefined the sci-fi neo-noir genre.I'm revisiting my opinions on this after having been caught in the Dune-craze following Villeneuve's film. In fact, I watched this a second time the day before I headed off to the cinema to watch it. And Villeneuve's Dune really was a modern science fiction epic for the modern age, but there are still some things which I prefer in Lynch's Dune. It's been almost 40 years since this first came out, and of course the visual effects have gotten significantly better, but there's still an almost too-sanitised feel to Villeneuve's version. I really loved the messy, campy, disgusting and industrial world of Lynch's Dune, and in my opinion Kyle MacLachlan gave a much better performance than Timoth√©e Chalamet.This film is weird. I mean, it's David Lynch, so I was expecting strangeness, but this, combined with Herbert's world, is a level of camp I thought couldn't feasibly be achieved. But having such a beautifully bizarre masterpiece is thousands of times better than having another mindless, CGI-fest Marvel movie. This was the first of Lynch's films that I ever watched (I know, maybe not off to the strongest start) and it made me check out his many other masterpieces, so listen to me when I mean that this is a GOOD FILM.In conclusion, watch this movie. Read the book, then watch it. Does not deserve any of the hate it receives.-Sasha."," Why does everyone hate this?"

I think this is one of the more underrated movies in Science Fiction history. It may be because the director himself was not happy with it, or because fans expected too much from a simple two hour movie.David Lynch famously brought his ""Dune"" vision to the screen in 1984. The film score for Dune was composed by the Rock group TOTO their first and only film score .

I am pointing this out as If one is not familiar with lore of Dune ,Lynch's film despite what critics and some fans may have said about the effort ; I personally think it is excellent ""a film that gives LSD hallucinations without taking LSD.""My favorite aspect, the visuals, absolutely breathtaking ! Lynch's version is a great starting point even though liberties were taken ; to learn the lore and charterers penned in Herbert's novel.Hardly a cohesive experience (Vintage Lynch) but individual scenes are brought to life with striking power.

I'm not giving a near-full rating because Lynch's Dune is nearly perfect - far from it - but because, unlike recent clueless attempts by Hollywood executives and market analysts, it's not only a better film, but mainly because it's actually a FILM - with a head and a heel, a beginning and an end, and something substantial in between, with characters of blood, milk and pus, with a healthy dose of properly hallucinogenic material and because it comes the closest of all attempts to Herbert's Dune (as much as you may dislike it) and not only manages to at least sort of pull off what others have completely broken their teeth on, but even still has the strength and the amazing audacity to throw LYNCH'S Dune on top of everything (even if only partially) and get away with it. And don't be fooled when Lynch tells you it's his worst film, because what he means is that he could make it even crazier... And that's something that deserves such a high rating - now more than ever... What's the farthest from perfect here are Baron and Paul (who haven't worked for anyone yet, and will always be the biggest challenge) and basically the entire second half (which, unlike the first part, is not as rewarding cinematically, as it's mostly about Paul's painful and complex transformation into the ultimate blockhead - which can be left out at worst, as happened here).

"142","Kung Fu Panda 4","Dr_Coulardeau","9/10","9 January 2007","That film is a superb adaptation of Frank Herbert's first novel of his Dune series. We could of course harp a lot about the symbolism of names, the Fremen being free men, and the Harkonnen having a Germanic name, and the Atreides having a Greek sounding name, and the Emperor having an Arab name, and we could also add that the witches, the Bene Gesserit have a Latin sounding name, etc. We could also said that the name of the hero, Muad'dib also sounds Arabic, or is it Hindi, though the frequent aspirated 'h' of this latter language is absent from this writing and pronouncing. But that is superficial and the worst name and being is not present in this film and book, the real Arabs, the Sligs, the hybrid of a giant slug and a pig, who are the direct reflection and mirror image of the caricature of the sly Arab living by the sharia so common in the West. What is interesting in this volume and film is the political intrigues along with the prophetic dimension of the plot. The political intrigues revolves around the Greek sounding Atreides, the honest ones from a planet of oceans and rain; the Germanic sounding Harkonnen, the rotten (actually rotting) polluting industrial ones who are violent, vicious and sadistic, slightly vampiristic too; the Persian sounding Emperor Shaddam, bringing together the Shah of Iran and all the Saddams of the Arab world; the Spacing Guild that controls the universe by controlling travelling in that universe; and finally the Fremen, an underground free species of human beings who believe in a prediction of a Messiah and are mostly invisible on the planet Dune. The Bene Gesserit is also present with their plan to produce the perfect new Messiah, God, Savior through genetic manipulations by guiding the reproductive schemes among the powerful from whom the Messiah can only come. He will nevertheless come for sure, but by accident and thanks to the alliance of Paul Atreides, the last representative of the Atreides House, his Bene-Gesserit-trained mother and the Fremen. Some will see in it the caricature of the world in the Cold War. Of course we have to know one thing that is not immediately clear: the fact that this world is the heir of the Butlerian Jihad that destroyed all thinking machines and then banned the construction of such machines, forcing human beings to develop their skills at calculating and thinking to keep the control over things. But this vision is slightly short. It goes beyond and it reaches the level of a reflection on what politics are: a fight among a very few superior leaders who are essential born as such and vaguely accepted by some managing more than governing council. Democracy is the value that is totally absent from this story. Even the Fremen are not democratic since they believe in a supreme leader, a messiah, and their actions are mostly mass-reactions, extremely collective methods of governing and controlling their own people. That future world then will not be different from the old feudal world of six or seven centuries ago. The people, the mass of people necessary for those constant wars and feuds, are nothing but pawns that die on the screen and in the sand of Dune without any kind of concern for their lives or even simply life. They are non-entities, including on the winning side of the Fremen. That world is dehumanized and does not defend any kind of ideal or principle. The film is perfect though with its special effects and its immense cosmic and desertic scenery. The film is very dense and thus the suspense is quite effective. The film then is nothing but an action film with good situations and interesting characters, be they heroes or be they monsters. This vision of the world remains rather primitive though and maybe even lower than what could be normal expectations. It satisfies though the desire for survival and victory over danger that lurks in the circumvolutions of the human brain. That's probably why this film, and the books behind, still have a positive life in our culture. Messianic characters and situations contrasted to apocalyptic treachery will always be a favorite of the human mind.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"," Beautiful vision of an archaic feudal world in the distant future"

The storyline follows an evil emperor who takes advantage of a planets inhabitants and takes their resources to fuel space travel. When the son of a new leader of the planet sees the ways of the local people he decides to join them to overthrow the emperor.This movie is directed by David Lynch (Mulholland Drive) and stars Kyle MacLachlan (Show Girls), Virginia Madsen (Candyman), Leonardo Cimino (Monster Squad), Francesca Annis (Krull), Brad Dourif (Child's Play), Everett McGill (Silver Bullet), Patrick Stewart (X-man) and Sting (Cold Mountain).The storyline for this is very intricate and contains great characters, setting and circumstances that really capture the imagination. The cast is brilliantly selected and the special effects are way better than they should be for 1984. I am always thoroughly impressed by the space special effects, the worms and the sets.

Otherwise sane and reasonable individuals start foaming at the mouth and twitching uncontrollably when recollecting the 15 minutes they managed to sit through. Others start screaming obscenities and become unable to articulate sentences to describe their loathing of this movie. I've yet to meet anybody who DIDN'T think it one of the worst movies ever made. Why is it, then, that I love it? 'Dune' is one of my favorite movies. I have watched it several dozen times and never tire of it. Despite De Laurentiis's butchering of both Lynch's screenplay, and the original cut of the movie, enough of the Director's signature style remain for his fans, with many moments that are pure Lynch; bizarre and disturbing ¬ñ the heart plugs, the caged cat, the weird incestuous homoerotic undertones, the muddled dream sequences. The entire thing is beautifully crafted with genuine Baroque excess. The production design is breathtaking, with a rare sense of new worlds being created and given their own aesthetic. Every character, though thoroughly over-the-top, is original and memorable, with Brad Dourif, Freddie Jones, Linda Hunt and Sian Phillips being particular favourites.I'm not sure why so many people find this movie so unwatchable.

I read the original Dune trilogy and so I realized that so much was missing, and there were odd little additions that were in the film but not in the books, which mostly were not effective. I just watched this same Dune on DVD and am impressed that the look is still very acceptable, unlike other films whose production styles ages them badly. I appreciated the movie more for what it was, which is more of a Readers' Digest Dune. A lot of important characters are marginalized in the film, and several notable scenes are missing. A film that had more of the detailed world of Dune and all of its characters would take 6-8 hours. The Harkonnens are overdone and overacted but you do get the idea that they are despicable.

They were directed to reflect on and criticize their characters without providing adequate context or background.We do not understand why Ben (Powell) is a fboy. Has he magically inherited his Hangman karma from Top Gun? Are we to infer that from his Patrick Bateman workout regiment? Was he that disappointed they did not have sex on the first date? Is he actually keen on his ex?Nor are we told why Bea (Sweeney) is conflicted about law school or understand why she broke up with her fiance. She always wanted to get married and possibly have a family. We are told as much.She says she didn't like they never fought with her fiance. But it's not the fighting she enjoys with Ben, and it's evident because they suck at it. They actually had a very pleasant first encounter characterized by the absence of any confrontation.If I am reading too much about rom-com characters, it is because these two seem fixed to question their thoughts and actions throughout the movie continuously. I cannot fathom how Gluck, who gave us a gem twenty years ago with Easy A and Emma Stone's memorable monologues, is responsible for this.There were a couple of moments when the movie tried to redeem itself.Powell decided the best way for Sweeney to inspect him for any crawling critters was by spreading his cheeks. Interestingly, this is the only part of the millennial vulgar wave humor they kept- perhaps to make amends for the overall lack of funny.The mother-in-law eventually puts an end to all non-adult behavior. ""No one is 29""- get it together.Not enough to stay through the whole thing."," Rom-com knowhow is lost"

I mean, I'm all for scenic shots, but did we really need a close-up of the Opera House every five minutes?

The movie takes place in Australia on beautiful beaches and an even more beautiful beach house.Reason number 2: The movie has really funny moments and not too many over-the-top cringe moments like other comedies.Reason number 3: The lead actors Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell in particular have a certain chemistry that makes it fun to watch.And reason number 4: The movie always sets ""cool"" scenes through well-chosen songs. The epitome of this is the creative use of ""Unwritten"".The typical romcom ending could perhaps have been implemented a little smarter, but the movie delivers no less than you would expect from a good romcom, in fact a little more."," Like your feelgood sitcom for Sunday evenings, only as a movie"

But after they spend the night together something goes wrong when Bee overhears Ben saying she's not good enough.After they fall out about what Ben said they get invited on a wedding of Bee sister wedding who happens to be getting married to his woman's best friend.The comedy was actually pretty good throughout the movie i remember during the movie the entire cinema was laughing for the comedy.There's something about this movie but I think this is the first Rom Com that actually has the chemistry between the two main stars Glenn Powell and Sydney Sweeney. Those two are both pretty attractive too which surely anyone can admit.I remember when I was serving a couple at my work they asked have I seen it and I said no no yet but I've heard some things they asked what things. I replied with all I've been told is Sydney Sweeney is pretty much in a bikini the whole movie.Another solid rom com to watch I would highly recommend watching this movie I think this is up there with the rest of the rom coms that I actually enjoyed.I hope these Rom Coms that are getting made keep being good because I think that's 2 Rom Coms in 2 that came out in the cinemas which was pretty good the Jennifer Lawernce one and Anyone but you.I would give this a 7 out of 10."," Anyone But You"

The film is simply a fun rom com loosely based on Much Ado About Nothing.Having studied the play, I found the film a fun and fresh take on the original plot and themes presented by Shakespeare. Along with the obvious references, the more subtle ones were clever and conceiving.The film was sharp, clever and included character development that I haven't seen in a contemporary romantic comedy since the early 2000's. The chapter adaptations were comedic and clever and well suited to a modern day setting and the inclusion of animal magic was well played. The charismatic leads and chemistry between Sweeney and Powell also made it both powerful and enjoyable.Anyone but you is perfect for what it intended to be- a modern twist on classic literature with some laughs, tears and loveable characters all with an interesting personal storyline."," Shakespeare ""fun"" fiction"

This film has a cute premise and the travelogue of Sydney is more than spectacular. The outline of the story is a good start, but the dialogue is below juvenile. There were more F bombs than in an action movie. In my humble opinion, the more four letter words in a script, the less likely the screenwriter is of their abilities. If you bother to watch 1930 comedies, the plot and dialogue are usually good enough that it's not necessary to shock the viewers.

"176","Anyone But You","barbett-1","5/10","1 January 2024","Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen.

"177","Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","4/10","5 January 2024","I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."," F-grade rom-com with little rom and even less com"
"178","Anyone But You","trinaboice","4/10","8 January 2024","IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage

"179","Anyone But You","ambusched94","2/10","31 December 2023","A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."," Forgettable rom-com that fails to spark and lacks believable romantic chemistry, hindered by bland acting from Sydney Sweeney and rushed, empty character development"

Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny.Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like the studio shelled out something to tick boxes rather than make a well thought-out comedy (this included plot concepts, wardrobing, and jokes) because that's what they think the audience 'wants' as they try too hard to be 'modern,' meaning the director couldn't make any creative decisions; the direction on both a macro and microscale feels very formulaic to other Rom-Coms; the direction of actors is very bad as he does not establish any chemistry for the cast as all the performances feel mundane and toneless; the storytelling is a formulaic and predictable Rom-Com), Bad Acting (Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (The overall performance feels mundane and toneless and she fails to establish any chemistry with Glen Powell, but she does have some moments where she does a decent to pretty good job), Decent to Pretty Good from Glen Powell (The only positive performance in the movie as he holds his own and leads the movie well as a Rom-Com lead (it's just the material is so bad he can only do so much)), Decent from Alexandra Shipp (Actually holds her own well and shows some a little range (which is a lot given this movie)), Bad from GaTa (Cannot match the levels of any of the other actors and feels very toneless with little effort), Pretty Bad from Hadley Robinson (Just doesn't offer anything), Decent from Michelle Hurd (Shows some experience and decent timing), Decent from Dermot Mulroney (Has some charisma and timing), Decent from Charlee Fraser (The most surprising performance of the movie as she holds her own fairly well and establishes some charm and chemistry with Glen Powell), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of toneless and stereotypical Rom-Com performances; there is no chemistry in the entire cast)), Very Bad Story (The concept is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing,' but it does not do anything to be unique as it just follows the cookie cutter Rom-Com plot (mixed with forced modern references); the story construction is incredibly formulaic as each scene is incredibly predictable on what is going to happen and where it is going to go; because the movie is so predictable, there is a flow because it just follows this boilerplate to a tea; the character writing is terrible as all the characters as so shallow and stereotypical to Rom-Coms (and things are brought up for characters that never get addressed or add more depth to the characters)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious and very predictable (the movie forces in so many modern references that it just feels like they are pandering to the youth rather than writing realistic dialogue); the joke hit rate is probably 1 out of every 5 jokes (and some of the jokes are just so stupid that its cringe at how they even made this movie); the symbolism is incredibly overt (with the quotes from the source material and the messages of the story being overlaid onto the screen); the foreshadowing is incredibly overt that it makes the movie incredibly predictable), Decent Score; Decent Soundtrack (Did enjoy the songs they chose), Pretty Good Cinematography (Very polished as you could tell the studio put in a lot of money to make this movie), Pretty Bad Sound (Some of the sound effects are just off from what happened), Decent Editing (The actual edit was very polished and felt like it had a big budget; the cut for the movie just feels weird as it is obvious where they did reshoots and what was originally shot), Good Costumes (They made a very conscious decision with what each character was wearing to get people to watch this movie (and I respect that)), Plot Structure followed the source material's and Rom-Com template to a tee (which made the movie incredibly formulaic and predictable), Pacing was decent (as it kept the Rom-Com pace), Climax was so forced and incredibly formulaic (which made me cringe very hard when watching this movie), Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms (especially from the early 2010s), It was so obvious where there were reshoots for this movie as some of the scenes were so bad and some were more tolerable."," Bad Movie"
"184","Anyone But You","masonsaul","7/10","30 December 2023","Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected). A good soundtrack always helps with this genre and the one here nails it."," Nice to have a rom com at the cinema again"
"185","Anyone But You","Remmuchan","3/10","27 December 2023","I cannot for the life of me understand how this ended up being a movie shown in theaters. I went into this having no idea what the movie was about. I can now say that I wish I never even bothered to purchase a ticket to see this atrocity. It was the biggest waste of my time ever.I cannot tell you how many times I cringed watching this and how many times I wanted it to just end. The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all. Terrible acting, terrible movie, terrible plot line, terrible directing, terrible EVERYTHING.I HATED this movie. Avoid at all costs."," How?"
"186","Anyone But You","MichaelByTheSea","9/10","26 December 2023","This was like an R rated raunchy Hallmark movie where people actually have sex. I can do without the miscommunication trope that drove apart a couple that seemed to be connecting, but I enjoyed the banter and really enjoyed the stars.""Serious"" critics typically don't appreciate the rom-com genre and judge them harshly. I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."," Pure escapism featuring beautiful people, beautiful locations with lots of laugh out loud moments"

"188","Anyone But You","NatKaminska","1/10","28 December 2023","I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"," Cringe, boring comedy with paper thin romance. If this is what is called romantic and funny nowadays, then love and comedy are dead!"
"189","Anyone But You","johnnymonsarrat","4/10","3 February 2024","Hello again, fellow film travelers.I have to wonder what happened to the writing of this movie. There are some interesting and touching twists to the plot. But mainly it seems plot driven, not character driven. Characters don't make consistent choices with their personality or logic, for example what happens with the parents at the end.The male lead has an acting style that's full of confidence, but he's supposed to be a comic figure that has disabling phobias. God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius. There was some good physical comedy and a few touchimg moments. But the cringe worthy flaws buried them."," Not goofy enough to be so plot driven, not character driven"

"191","Anyone But You","gerrgrady-86307","2/10","27 December 2023","My husband and I chose this movie as a Saturday treat. We left around the halfway mark because I kept hoping that it would improve - a waste of time & our weekly movie budget. The actors were given dialog that was juvenile and scene set-ups that were embarrassing. Lots of gratitious nudity and shots of partial nudity. Anyone interested in seeing this movie should just watch the trailer - it gives viewers a good picture of what they'll see at the theater so they don't waste their time sitting through a really bad movie. It was great seeing Bryan Brown but I wish he had chosen a better vehicle in which to appear than this dreck. I had greater expections for Glen Powell, but then maybe this is the level of his actual talent. Sad."," Terrible movie, beautiful location"
"192","Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4/10","4 January 2024","Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties. Just so you know: you don't get a (proper) view of Sweeney's melons, but you do get to see a squeezed Australian glans. 4/10."," This genre needs a little more right now"
"193","Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","7/10","6 January 2024","Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."," Light, breezy, and plenty of fun!"
"194","Anyone But You","tm-sheehan","6/10","5 January 2024","My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."," All that glitters is not Gold"

Weak story, unnecessarily extensive vulgar language, and excessive nudity humiliates the actors. Embarrassing movie that degrades men and women and shows no imagination.

Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker.

"197","Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5/10","5 January 2024","Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film.

So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch.
