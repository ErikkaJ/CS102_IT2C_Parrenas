"1","Dune: Part Two","AnUglyTruth","9/10","9 March 2024","Dune Part Two is a phenomenal cinematic experience on an epic scale. Movies of this calibre are a rarity these days.Denise Villeneuve is operating on a completely different level, a world class filmmaker. The execution, picturesque visuals and the sound score make this a spectacle which deserves the imax experience.Part two literally picks up where the first movie left off and watching the continuation of Paul's journey and seeing him go on to become Muad'dib is mesmerising.This is sci-fi greatness, only with a slight pacing critique as the movie feels rushed towards the end and certain deviations from the book which stops it from being a true masterpiece.Bring on Dune Messiah!"," A modern sci-fi epic which deserves the IMAX experience"
"2","Dune: Part Two","pexualis-50413","8/10","5 March 2024","Great actors, nice humor, amazyng scenes. One of the best movies for years. Almost 3 hours but easy to watch and enyoj. War scenes on the end of movie should last more, I think that director cut most important part of the movie in just 10 minute. War scenes at the end should last much more. And some parts before are very slow going, simmilar like in part one, but that's not big problem like in part one. I really hope that part 3 will be 10/10 because this book and story deserves only the best! Everyone Who have Imax near should watch it in this kind of cinema, because this is really that tipe of movie, for biggest possible screen."," Great movie"
"3","Dune: Part Two","gregchic","4/10","11 March 2024","This film is not made for people that actually read the book, which is indicative of Hollywood and their monetary backers, sound good, effects great, but the story does not exist, which is not a tribute to Frank Herbert, if you like the book, you are better served by watching the William Hurt version, which serves Franks memory better, the only saving grace for me was Javier Bardem and his portrayal of Stillgar, albeiet with some humour, I don't blame the Director, it's just like LOTR, some books are hard to portray in 480 minutes, I do not mind a slight difference in the story, but whole gaps and missing chapters sometimes make you lose what the storyteller wanted, as Beau would say....it's just a thought."," All spectacle but no storyline"
"4","Dune: Part Two","elitetxin","10/10","9 March 2024","Held my attention from start to finish. The effects and cinematography on display is outstanding. The score is unlike anything I have ever heard and is perfectly suited for the movie. The characters are all complex with their own motivations and goals. 100% recommend seeing this in a high quality cinema for the best experience, it's worth it. Now I'm just waiting for the next entry in this enthralling series. PS: the movie follows on immediately from the previous film without any recap at all so you should rewatch part one or watch some sort of recap to understand what is going on at all times."," Breathtaking"
"5","Dune: Part Two","fszsmzp","4/10","11 March 2024","Denis Villeneuve delivered us another disappointment. After part 1 I was hoping that once we hit the bottom there is only way up but he found another bottom of his talent to descent to. Very choppy development of the storyline. 2 hours of nothing and then 30 seconds of battle. Anyone with half a talent could have made a masterpiece with this story and the budget but Denis destroyed a memory of the story and the game many of us grew up on. There are so many shortcomings in the movie that it's easier to mention the good. Once I come up with something I will update the review for now its just bad aftertaste and wasted 2.5 hours of my life."," Terrible attempt to resurrect a failed part 1"
"6","Dune: Part Two","zvkqmjvh","6/10","10 March 2024","It was definitely way more exiting than the first one, with more interesting characters, and absolutely stunning cinematography. I'd say it's definitely worth watching on a big screen and it's definitely more enjoyable with real booming speakers. But my main two qualms with this movie were, number one: it was too long, three hours? We couldn't have shaved off like forty five minutes? I just don't want to be picking up my phone to check how much longer. Number two it left on another cliffhanger! I thought I had a realistic hope that this three hour sequel would nicely wrap up the series in a nice satisfying way. But it didn't. It left open ended with obvious intentions of a third movie, so great.All in all I'd say it's a cinematic triumph that was just lacking a little girth. Would recommend if you're a sci-fi buff, but it's a one time watch for me."," Better than the first one, still missing something"
"7","Dune: Part Two","vincentfarmer-27675","10/10","10 March 2024","Dune part 2 was what I expected and more. It was most likely the best experience I've ever had watching a movie and I think it is a must watch for everyone. The cinematography was stunning, the performances were very good and the score by Zimmer is just unbelievable, it gives me chills every time and makes the epic scene significantly more epic. Paul's development in this movie reminds me a lot of Anakin in the revenge of the sith. He becomes really powerful and kills every one that stands in his way and I think seeing that power land in his hands makes this movie that much more satisfying. Also Austin Butler's portrayal of Feyd-Rautha was bone chilling. In every one of his scenes he looked so ready to take someone's head off and that kind of psychopathic villain alleviates a movie to a whole other level.Bravo Denis."," Long live the fighters!"
"8","Dune: Part Two","paschalinaioannidou","7/10","6 March 2024","It's a really good sequel but I didn't feel the bond between Paul and the Fremen neither the romance.You are able to understand that the time passed and I understand that that they did not have the time to show everything but because of that the build up was very steady until the final battle.I do not know maybe I was expecting something more due to the high rating and good comments on the film.Other than that the film was great with wonderful scenes, amazing special effects and CGI of course.It is truly a very good apparently for the new era of the sci-fi film and we need this quality on the cinema."," High quality film indeed but it held stability for too long"
"9","Dune: Part Two","wsqmcj-17332","10/10","10 March 2024","Dune: Part Two is a cinematic masterpiece and always will be. Just recently I went to see this film in IMAX screening and it was unbelievable. There is no doubt this film will win best picture of the year; that is how good it is.It's not just the visual effects and costumes though, it's the story and especially the characters. In both films you grow feelings for Paul and Chani and want to know more about there story. It'll always want you leaving more as it did me. We need Dune Messiah now and Children of Dune. I'm not a big book fan, but I'm after I got out of the theater I instantly looked on Amazon for both books. If you really want to watch a movie that might change your life watch both Dune and Dune: Part two.Kudos to director Denis Villeneuve for giving me the movie experience of a lifetime."," I made an account just for this movie.."

"11","Dune: Part Two","wolfgangpeters-70447","8/10","11 March 2024","In contemplating the intricate web of power, politics, and fate woven within Dune , one cannot help but be drawn into a deep existential reflection on the nature of humanity and the universe. I am particularly struck by the themes of agency, determinism, and the interplay between individual will and external forces.The character of Paul Atreides, as he navigates the treacherous politics of the desert planet Arrakis, serves as a symbol of human ambition and hubris. In his quest for power and survival, Paul grapples with questions of free will and destiny, ultimately realizing the futility of attempting to control the course of events.The world of Dune is a complex and richly textured tapestry of cultures, religions, and ideologies, all vying for dominance in a universe governed by mysterious forces beyond mortal comprehension. The struggle between the powerful Houses, the enigmatic Bene Gesserit sisterhood, and the nomadic Fremen people underscores the constant flux of power and influence in a universe where nothing is certain.As the plot unfolds and alliances shift, ethical dilemmas and moral quandaries abound, challenging the characters and the audience to confront their own notions of right and wrong. The themes of sacrifice, loyalty, and betrayal are woven throughout the narrative, inviting us to ponder the nature of justice and the limits of moral responsibility.In conclusion, Dune 2 kick ass 15% more than the first one, I'll take it."," the power of Dune"
"12","Dune: Part Two","brighamshupe","10/10","10 March 2024","I'm going to start off by saying this was an amazing movie. It had a great story, amazing sound design, and really good special effects. CGI nowadays is rushed and it is not as good as it could be. Newer marvel movies tend to have terrible CGI even with a massive budget, and it really could be done better, and this makes me appreciate CGI like this so much more.I don't get people who don't watch long movies, or even movies at all. I think if there is a good story with a lot to tell, as much as possible should be included. I love stories like Lord of the Rings or Star Wars (the classics) that take the time they need to tell the story. Not all movies are fit for a multi parter but I think we should get more. I don't know much about filmmaking, but I think it would have been cheaper to release a single movie and slap together a sequel if it does well. This makes it really cool that they made some bad financial decisions to put together an amazing movie. I hate newer movies being fast paced and cheap, and I think Dune did a really good job avoiding that."," FINALLY ANOTHER MULTI PART FILM"
"13","Dune: Part Two","pheaksolim","8/10","1 March 2024","One of the best movie I've seen. The characters are almost look similar to the previous Part One (perhaps they started the Part 2 right after the part one?). The Special Effect, the sound, the cinematography were astounding.Aside from the screen was flashing from dark scenes to a very bright scenes that some of us kinda felt shock from a number of times.With 2h 46m there should be more fighting scenes.AND there should be much more vengeances from Paul Atreides to those who attempted to genocide his whole generation in Part One.Look forward to seeing the much satisfied Dune Part 3 which should be the final one?"," Flashing your eyes"
"14","Dune: Part Two","omrmd","6/10","2 March 2024","This movie is really good and worth the wait and great visuals but im just gonna talk about the plot loopholes which just bugged me firstly about the flaws of the story on how they ended the story with empire they built their characters to be too big and ended them in one scene and stuck in one room trembling of fear as they were receiving the strikes from these sand people! I mean , how can formidable emperor be this stupid to fall to this trap and just land where they want and not know the weather of the planet and refuse the advice to leave for orbit until the storm settled ,and what happened to letting the war begin and bringing peace ! And why would the duke wants this unpredictable nobody to be empire instead of the (clueless) old guy or his daughter!He would've accepted the job without being given this incentive! And in the end the emperor kissed the ring and the daughter accepted the marriage , why would the other big families refuse his ascension to the throne !! That would be understandable if he slaughtered them and wanted to marry the one he loved !"," Fantastic movie but"
"15","Dune: Part Two","miastefanova","7/10","14 March 2024","The movie we waited for and been hyped for did not disappoint when it comes to cinematography. Visually 10/10, it makes you live in the Dune universe. And then once you're in it, you wait for the plot to build up. Which they tried doing but never really even scratched the full potential of the characters or the abilities of this brilliant cast. The conversations were choppy, the emotions were shallow, the viewer couldn't really connect to any of the character's emotions or journey. Let alone those of Paul. Me as a viewer couldn't emotionally attach to Chani & Paul's love. It was only introduced briefly here and there while we are actually being focused on Paul's emotional growth/development journey. Also, with such a heavy press tour & the background that was given to the viewer that Zendaya & Timothy are best friend in real life, it was even harder to feel their on screen chemistry."," Visual masterpiece, narrative downfall"
"16","Dune: Part Two","rvrqvfjza","6/10","12 March 2024","A loud space opera full of ethno kitschThe second part of Dune repeats many of the problems of the first part. There are the lengthy static shots; instead of rhythm, a loud roar accompanies every scene that is supposed to have a dramatic effect. Sometimes less would have been more, Mr. Zimmer. It's as if the movie is selling the audience for fools, as if the projectionist turns up the volume a few decibels every other scene so that no one misses the great drama unfolding on the screen. Because the images are only sometimes able to tell the story. Certainly, the ride on the sandworm and the first raid on a Spice harvester fill the entire movie theater. Similarly, some characters such as Rebecca Fergurson or Austin Butler can certainly arouse interest with their mysterious nature. But then again, the story is too one-dimensional, the religious element is only scratched on the surface and the fight against the Harkonnen ultimately dissolves into a dune chase against Nazis. As a blockbuster, Dune 2 only lands in the midfield and does not live up to the overly enthusiastic reviews."," A loud space opera full of ethno kitsch"
"17","Dune: Part Two","nick-72866","8/10","8 March 2024","The two Dune Films remind me of Lawrence of Arabia. All in all a great film! I will recommend this film to everyone, as in my opinion this will become a classic and will reach the top 20 of the best films of all times.Nick Kraguljac
PS.:
Unfortunatly there were scenes deleted, which interrupted the flow and left questions open!1. How did Paul get out of the dessert?2. How could Paul all of a sudden ride the worm - some scenes of training are missing
3. How did the nephew of Baron Hakonen come about to know of the name Muad'Dib.In addition the beginning of Dune Part Two does not fit to the aprut ending of Part One.This is why I only gave 8 instead of 10.I hope that after Part Three there will be a Directors cut, including all the deleted scenes which are necessary to fill the voids."," Missing Links"
"18","Dune: Part Two","gantulga-68703","6/10","3 March 2024","Let us be frankly honest here. Dune part 2 is visually astonishing piece with good touch from Hans Zimmer. But, when it comes to logic and moving the emotions, it was just mediocre film overall. It has a lot of unneccesary violence and unneccessary scenes. Plus it was kinda boring. Only CGI worms and miners battle scenes kept me awake. When it had a lot of potential of good stories and reasons, they choose to show us unneccessary violence and nonsense killings. As a huge science fiction fan, I was disappointed tbh. Who can we ask for the explanation of the dead man's sudden revival, Chani's helicopter, deathworms control etc. Most of the good science fiction movies leave at least a little bit of explanation, clue or anything. Well, perhaps I shouldnt ask why they were big fan of engaging in hand to hand combat when they had duper high technology??? You want to say because of armor shielding? Duh. As for the acting, Timothee was mediocre, Zendeya was perfect, Bardem was funny as hell. And, whenever Rececca Ferguson appeared, I wanted throw up or something. Others were not relatable or noticeable. Best movie since LOTR? Cmon. I go to cinema to be moved by emotions, not be shaked with effects."," Overrated! Only Mongolian deathworms keep it relevant"
"19","Dune: Part Two","vgqkgtmk","2/10","4 March 2024","Very bad, and just boring long movie. I was bored watching the first one but thought maybe part 2 will be better.Did not. Zendaya is the only thing keeping this movie together and making people paying for tickets.Also the casting makes no sense. Very long scene like part one where you lose interest or fall a sleep. Which I did in the cinema. I have to say the directing in the desert was cool and the images were nice to look at, but other than that no. Save your money and watch the movie when it is available on streaming later on.The lead actor Timothy is very bad actor, not sure how he got the lead role. Should have been much stronger lead."," Zendaya is the only good thing about this movie"
"20","Dune: Part Two","humanumx","7/10","3 March 2024","Great views, great music, but is it really much better than older one ? For me not necessary. Although bad effects in old story but as the whole, plots given in old version were far better and were one joint unity in comparison to current hit. Film adopted to rather not demanding viewer - landscapes and music is to replace content...if you are interested in good music as background and fine views its for you. On the other hand splitting in for to parts makes it to long and to boring at least at the begginig of the film.Good play of main character and few other actors / actress, but as a whole i give just strong 7."," Rather show than .... ?"
"21","Dune: Part Two","southrnboy-76590","6/10","2 March 2024","Dune Part 2 missed the mark for me. While it is visually appealing, it lacks the narrative depth and intrigue present in the novel. The book presents a complex web of plots and machinations interwoven into one story; the movie is more akin to other sci fi spectacles, and leans into an action movie vibe, which tonally doesn't work with the source material. It's like it's trying to be both things at the same time, and as a result accomplishes neither.Many of the character arcs and storylines present in the novel are either heavily altered, or missing entirely. Naturally, a decent amount of this is to be expected whenever a narrative work is converted to film, but with Denis Villeneuve's Dune 2, the the changes are as numerous as they are baffling. Alia is never born in the film, and she doesn't kill the Baron. Paul does? (and the Emperor?) The introduction of Alia was perfect in book, and helps to revitalize the progression of events, keeping the story gripping and thought provoking. The movie on the other hand, spends an extortionate amount of time explaining the water of life, and exploring Jessica's new role as a Reverend Mother.In summary, Dune Part 2 is a visually appealing, narratively lacking, cinematic experience, which is refreshing when contrasted with many other recent films. Those that are new to the dune universe will likely be somewhat entertained, whereas fans of the books will probably be frustrated at the various alterations and changes."," Too different from the book"
"22","Dune: Part Two","jordanthan","9/10","4 March 2024","After many delays, it is finally time to experience the DUNE pill. Denis Villeneuve delivered his promise of fully adapting one of the most influentially dense sci-fi novels ever. Dune (2019) laid the groundwork, and now the sequel expands on everything established. The acting, music, cinematography, writing, visual effects, costumes, editing, audio mixing, and everything else about the film is astonishing. I can see decades' worth of passion laced in the filmmaking. If you're going to watch this film, find the closest theatre and experience in IMAX. I just hope Denis can go one more round for Messiah."," It was worth it"
"23","Dune: Part Two","polr-64978","10/10","11 March 2024","This film just blew my mind. The way Villeneuve brings us to the Arrakis is phenomenal.The performance of every actor is just stunning, but Austin Butler's and Timothée's are wonderful, and I would strongly say that both are an Oscar deserved performances.The visuals, the soundtrack, the effects, the make-up, the costume, I could go on for eternity, but everything would lead to the same point. Everything is perfect. Just a masterpiece of cinema.This is what cinema is made for. I'm sure that this film will raise a generation the same way Star Wars and Lord of the Rings did in their time. When the credits came in, I realized what a masterpiece I had seen, and that this film will always be in a part of my life."," MASTERPIECE"
"24","Dune: Part Two","altenhofkontakt","5/10","4 March 2024","The long-awaited sequel to Villeneuve's interpretation of Dune offers moviegoers outstanding cinematography, costumes and set designs. For an action-heavy movie, however, the film weakens in the choreography of the fights, where punches theatrically go nowhere and blows are thrown as if in a martial arts B-movie. But what is far more significant is the pale characterization and the sometimes outrageously banal, weak dialog (including the most pathetic declarations of love in recent film history). The movie oscillates between grandeur and patheticness. While at one point the director succeeds in staging something of philosophical greatness, the high flight repeatedly ends at low points such as the completely one-dimensional good-evil characterization. It has the absurdity of a running gag when a Harkonnen scoundrel slits the neck of an assistant who is merely correcting or warning him for the third or so time. Even sillier is the super-villain outfit worn by the terribly mad Harkonnen antagonist Feyd-Rautha during his vendetta on Arrakis - a reminder of the most banal Marvel films."," Ups and downs on the desert planet"
"25","Dune: Part Two","tzrkfg","6/10","2 March 2024","Went last night with a close friend and fellow sci-fi enthusiast to watch the premiere of DUNE Part Two. As with the first one, I felt, well... conflicted. Like eating too much of something decadent and rich yet left soon after feeling un-satisfied, a bit queezy and confused on how you are not so fulfilled by something that just moments ago gave you such great satisfaction. Honestly I don't know how to better describe the overall experience of seeing Denis Villeneuve's visually sumptuous vision of Frank Herbert's novel. It is a meal of empty calories.I could get into dissecting this for days, but why do that? Go see it for yourself and experience it. Then go home and watch David Lynch's 1984 version and feel even more confused, amused and downrightight satisfied with such unforgettableble momentsts like Sir Patrick Stewart with a mullet, the most terrifying over the top menacing floating fat man imaginable, a creepy Reverend Mother played by a 4 year old, an amazinging sound score, and yes... the holy grail... SPACE PUGS!Don't get me wrong the two chapter movie that is Denis Villeneuve's DUNE, is certainly worth the watch, but Lawrence of Arabia, it is not.""Long Live the Fighters!"""," Where are the Space Pugs? We need more Space Pugs!"
"26","Dune: Part Two","AfricanBro","9/10","26 February 2024","Phenomenal stuff. I'll probably calm down tomorrow but right now my heart's beating like crazy and my brain's screaming it's a bloody masterpiece. This is one of the few movies that I didn't try to control my expectations beforehand and it still surpassed them in many ways.""Power over spice is power over all""- that kinda turned out to be a lie at the end. As The movie starts, I felt an immediate sense of tension through its score. It's a cinematic experience; I can't imagine feeling the same lying at home in bed, watching in headphones. The resonating vibrations as the sounds reverberate through the theater created an epic atmosphere.When Part One came out people said it was ""game of thrones in space"", I wasn't really taken by that as much, especially since people said the same about Apple TV's Foundation series. So I just enjoyed the movie as Dune and bore no comparisons. After watching part two however I see it; the world building, the politics, the epic grandeur of it all.However, the first half of Dune Part Two is pretty grounded and calm, delving into the lives of the Fremen. It almost feels like two distinct movies, the first half intricately setting the stage for the climactic third act and reinforcing character connections established in Dune Part One. Unlike the Part One's focus on lore, this movie is more devotion-driven, also resembling a political narrative, especially knowing of the hidden puppeteers behind the empire. The result appears to be an intricate web of schemes involving the empire, the witch-advisor women(can't spell their names lol), and the Baron's family. Despite the emperor's pulling the strings, the Baron's family still felt like main antagonist to me.The second half of the movie is where we see the epic scale of dune. The movies not quick paced but you couldn't tell, I was absolutely immersed in it.I absolutely loved the kind ""The mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi."" Theatre burst out in laughter. It felt weird, I wasn't expecting any humour. It's funnier than I expected. More lively than the first Dune movie. I'd already seen the Usul-worm-riding scene from the Dune Part One reopening bonus content. I was still just as excited and it didn't spoil a thing.The visual brilliance, as expected was stunning, elevating every aspect. The authenticity of the scenes made it feel as if characters were immersed in the environment, rather than merely placed against a green screen. I loved the portrayal of time passing through Paul's changing eyes; the longer he stays the bluer his eyes get. Despite how lively it is, the plot, while progressing at a measured pace, remains engaging, drawing attention away from its deliberate slowness. It has much more action, the battles were absolutely epic, I feel like they could have been longer but they still captivated me.Jessica disappears for a while, but just when I thought that, she showed up. Other than Paul and Zendeya, the rest of the cast doesn't really get as much screen time as you'd think. I loved the baby/embryo/featus scenes. Batista with no mask in the desert while his whole team's suited up was badass. I love him in darker roles, although I think some moments felt overly animated. But it gave an effective contrast to Austin Butler though, I couldn't wait to see what his character was like. Very fierce, intimidating and psycho. The girl shivering with the plate in her hands before the gladiator games made me chuckle. Butler did also sound like the baron at times.Dune: Part Two stands steady on its own, it felt complete compared to the more introductory feel of Part One. Despite this, I still felt like it lays groundwork for Dune: Part Three/Messiah, leaving a sense of setup. The movie, while feeling like a precursor, still manages to provide a more conclusive ending. I also think you should watch Part One first, if that has to be said; and the prospect of a back-to-back viewing sounds like a fun afternoon.One thing I can complain about is Stilger. I have mixed feelings. In Part One, Javier was fierce and was my favorite character, in this movie though he's depicted as a religious fanatic for the most part. It was done well, but I still miss the Stilgar who walked up to Duke Leto Atreides with no disregard. This felt like a different person, still fierce, just different.Loved Austin butler though, I wasn't sure what to expect as I tried my best to avoid trailers and teasers apart from the Dune part one bonus content. That short lady in charge of extracting 'the water of life' had some insane calves on her, I'm extremely jealous.While I was initially not convinced about Timothée Chalamet as the lead, he truly owns the role in the sequel, displayed acting facets I'd not seen before from him. The movie essentially unfolds as Paul Atreides' coming-of-age story, with Zendaya delivering an amazing performance. The first act, focusing on their love story, adds depth to the events at the movie's end. Zendaya's portrayal transcends the typical love story, I hope her role extends into Dune: Messiah, and hopefully adds further complexity to her character.We see Paul undergo some transformations. From being the son of royalty to experiencing love, the narrative takes a surprising turn when he assumes authority in the third act. Although I liked it, it felt a bit rushed. But, I found solace/logic with the ""water of life"" spiritual poison, where drinking it resulted in a profound shift in your personality. The contrast between the before and after versions of Paul, as well as Jessica, is striking so it kinda made sense to me.I think watching this movie at home won't do it justice, it's clearly made for the big screens if you can. It's pretty epic and I think it'll remain memorable as one of 2024's best movies, despite only being February. I absolutely loved it."," Long live the fighters"

And combined with Part 1, we have one of the greatest adaptations in genre literature history.It's clear everyone on set was aware that they were working on something special here - because literally every single person in this production have brought their A-Game for a truly incredible technical achievement. And easily the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring.Paced to perfection, at once uniquely beautiful, thought-provoking and beyond THRILLING. Dave Bautista fights someone to the death, while hanging onto the outside of a helicopter that is being shot out of the sky - and that doesn't even reach the Top 10 action set-pieces in the film..

"30","Dune: Part Two","Dvir971","4/10","26 February 2024","Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended."," The Sci-Fi/Fantasy Epic of our Generation"

Personally, I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well. So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer.For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress.

"32","Dune: Part Two","poseyfan","10/10","1 March 2024","""Dune"" has been successfully put to the big screen. Not only is this a good adaptation, it passes with flying colors.The character arc of Paul Atreides is fascinating and complex. I love how they delved into his psyche and motivations so prevalently in this movie. He is reluctant to take up the Messianic mantle because he knows it's a lie. But things go according to his vision and he becomes a morally complex character. Religious fantacism takes hold of the fremen.It is up for interpretation what kind of character Paul becomes. Is he a tyrant? Was it the only path? What does religion have to do with it? Paul takes hold of the Bene Gesserit lie by exploiting faith.This leads to other questions. Can one truly trust the arm of flesh? The frailty of man? Leaders have come and gone throughout history bringing different ideals.One's own morality comes into play. Agency is vital to the human experience. Man will always falter. This leads to questions of a higher power and His role. Is there a God above? What are the implications of that?We don't get stories like this in Hollywood anymore. There is no happy ending in Dune, and one can only ponder the moral complexities of it. The book and movie have made me contemplate many things and I deeply appreciate stories like that.Others have already applauded the effects, acting and script, so I won't go into that too much here. What I will say is it was the best looking movie I have ever seen. Everything looked lived in. The fight scenes were choreographed masterfully. Each actor gave outstanding performances. Hans Zimmer gives a mesmerizing soundtrack.Frank Herbert's vision was honored masterfully. Well done Denis Villeneuve."," Paul Atreides is handled masterfully"

"36","Dune: Part Two","thePopcornExplorer","8/10","7 March 2024","I have to start by saying that I absolutely loved the first movie. I wasn't familiar with the story and I went with zero expectations, only to be completely stunned by the masterful artwork that was Dune Part 1.The music, the sound, the visuals, the entire world and its atmosphere, the characters even the plot, I found everything beautifully crafted and a breath of fresh air for the Sci-Fi genre.I am not familiar with the source material so this is considering only the movies and while I had a deep desire to love this second part specially considering the reviews it has been getting and how much I loved the first one, I couldn't help but feel a slight disappointment...
Let's start with the positives - the cinematography is consistently out of this world, it is a visual wonder, a mix of practical effects with CGI that blends in perfectly. The intense and dramatic sound effects associated with a thrilling and daunting soundtrack delivers! And of course the acting is consistently good, this time around it was great to see Javier Barden's character being developed and bringing some great topics to the table.What makes me wonder the most to be honest is how different both the first movie and the second are being reviewed by the general public..
For once its running time is considerable (almost 3 hours) and somehow it feels strangely rushed... It's a bit odd to explain but in other words, we get so many scenes that feel that don't contribute at all to the narrative and out of the blue we transition to a scene where the main character changes the demeanor entirely without much build up leading to it..
The movie spends so much time trying to connect Paul to the Fremens, yet it fails to explore his own inner motivations, the moment we see his character changing, it gives you the feeling that you missed something.Paul's betrayal to Chani also feels a bit irrelevant since the chemistry built on the first movie seems to just dissipate...
The relationship with his mother is also very odd and inconsistent, her character becomes dark fairly early in the movie, in one moment she is her beloved mother and without much shared screen time he then seems to almost despise her by the end of the film without the audience having a deeper understanding of their relationship dynamic.The newly introduced villains are one dimensional and having Austin Butler's character seemed pointless... there was no goal for him, he gets killed off almost instantly alongside with the Baron who got so much build from the first movie...
An A list of actors like Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken and Léa Seydoux, all of them could've been amazing characters but get zero chance of showing that.An entire plot with Paul's sister goes out the drain as well... messing with time started to become promising but it leads nowhere... I mean I could go on, in short the movie had many plot gaps, didn't develop the characters properly, poorly introduced the newcomers and relied heavily on its outstanding cinematography and sound.It's a shame because I can't tell you how excited I was to write a praising review, but this was my honest opinion which apparently doesn't seem to align with the majority.A lot of scenes drag without much substance to it, the highlight of the film was Javier Barden's character and the messages behind the dangerous of the concept of a Messia.I am of course hopeful for the third movie, maybe with my expectations now lowered it becomes a great experience all over again."," Visual masterpiece, questionable narrative"

"39","Dune: Part Two","geotech-27507","6/10","2 March 2024","As with the first film, the production was beautiful. I loved the opening scenes with the Harkonnen soldiers. The arena fight between Austin Butler and the last Atreides Robert Yuan (actors names) was fantastic. The battles with the harvesters were phenomenal.The script, however, left me a little bit disappointed. What about the Guild Navigators? And how were the worms used after they came through the pass in the mountains opened up by the atomics? There was only one sequence of the initial charge (marvelous sequence when the gunships entered) but then nothing. The Sardurkar were not given enough respect in this film. There was only one scene that showed them respect and that was when they rose up from the fallen sand and rock debris and stood their ground preparing for the oncoming onslaught instead of panicking. Other than that I felt the film should have spent more time on tactical combat scenes in what was supposed to be an epic battle at the end of the film, maybe trim time off of the other dragged out sequences in the film. The first movie did a better job with the Sardaukar, you actually feared them. The epic battle at the end of this movie was less than epic. And poor Bautista, they should not have made him act like such a wimp, should have had a more glorious fight even in retreat.As much as I like Walken, I thought he was poorly cast to be Emperor. The 1984 film had a perfect actor for the personality. This is Villeneuve's fault, he picked him.The script also fails to emphasize that Paul is the Kwisatz Haderach at the end of the movie. Paul's initial ability to vaguely see the future comes from the centuries of genetic tinkering of the women of the Ben Gesserat, but after he drinks the water of life and not only survives but develops the ability to see an individual's past, as evident by the scenes in the Fremen temple where he looks at individuals and describes their past, and more clearly sees optional future outcomes, and after he actually fulfills all of the prophecies of the Fremen, the story is true, he really is the Messiah of Arrakis, justifying the religion, and he really is the Kwisatz Haderach, a man with abilities that no other man has. But the film appears to gloss over this. Shame. He is not just some populist charismatic man blamed by the likes of Zendaya's character for (perceived) fooling anyone to follow him and falling for the appeal of power and giving up his principles, he is more than that.My critique of the first film was not enough emotion, well part 2 does a better job, especially after Paul survives the water of life and becomes the anti-hero, all hell breaks loose. And Zendaya's character being a more independent women than the 1984 film was interesting, albeit the combat skills or luck were not realistic unless you buy that the Sardaukar were that inept. Part 1 was a better drama than part 2, but part 2 has some great action sequences, besides the disappointments I mentioned earlier. Not a perfect film for this Dune 1984 admirer."," Beautiful production, less than perfect script"

"42","Dune: Part Two","Jason24321","8/10","2 March 2024","Frank Herbert's Dune is widely considered to be some of the most challenging science fiction material to adapt to the big screen. In 2021, Villeneuve hit it out of the park with Dune - Part One. In Part Two, he outdoes himself in every way. From cinematography to music to choreography to acting and dialogue, this movie had a mountain to climb to prove itself, and it did.With Hans Zimmer composing the score, it should surprise no one how well it compliments the film. Greig Fraser (Dune - Part One, The Creator, The Batman) was at the helm of cinematography, and really took my breath away with the magnificent vistas, incredible use of colours and even infrared, and expert capture of motion and scale. Fraser explains that they shot in digital, transposed to 35mm, then back to digital. This seemed absurd to me, until he explained that digital appeared too crisp for audiences, and film too nostalgic. His method obtained the perfect balance. I can't fault him for that, because I agree.The real risk here is of course the adaptation. How to retain some of the richest and most beloved science fiction lore in existence and condense it into the 2 hours and 46 minutes runtime. Villeneuve took a huge risk by splitting the first book into two parts. Had studios not green-lit part two, we would have been left with half a book. Unsatisfying for everyone. Thankfully the gamble paid off, and he was able to tell the epic story across two movies bordering on three hours. Even this required a brisk pace, with many notable scenes omitted. Despite this, I think Villeneuve retained the heart and soul of the story. He created two movies which appeal to both general audiences, and fans alike. There is so much to love here that I can't imagine anyone walking away feeling unsatisfied with the price of entry.See this on the biggest screen you can find. Then see it again. The visuals and score demand it. You will not be disappointed."," A Masterpiece"

"45","Dune: Part Two","nerrdrage","7/10","11 March 2024","Part 2 eclipses the first movie and builds on it, setting up what will no doubt be an impressive trilogy.The biggest worry I had about adapting Dune is Paul. Over the course of the story, he changes from a likable kid into something more cosmic and inhuman, and that might be a problem for the audience, since stories usually need a relatable character. Timothée Chalamet manages this transition skillfully and believably but it still leaves the audience without their relatable character.Villeneuve seems to have hit on an ideal solution: beef up the role of Chani so that she becomes that relatable character. I can already envision her role in the third movie of the trilogy, which no doubt is already being planned given the huge box office success of this movie.This is a big departure from the books but the third movie is going to have to be more of Villeneuve's invention that the first two were, anyway."," next year's Best Picture winner"
"46","Dune: Part Two","davidmvining","6/10","1 March 2024","Denis Villeneuve's second half of his adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune fully embraces the spectacle inherent in the material while also digging into the core implications that Herbert was exploring around power, cults of personality, and leadership. He flips some things around (I'm pretty sure), but otherwise delivers a handsome, exciting, second half to what he had started. And then he highlights Chani way too much, changing her character so much that she sticks out like a sore thumb to curious purposes that do little more than distract from what's going on around her. Seriously, if the final twenty seconds of this film were chopped off and lost in a fire, I'd actually be a good bit more positive on the film.Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother the Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have joined the Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Barden). Paul grows close to Chani (Zendaya) who helps teach him the ways of the desert as they go into hiding from the dominant Harkonnen led by the Baron (Stellan Skarsgard), his elder nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista) left as governor of the desert planet Arrakis while the Baron continues to groom his younger nephew Feyd (Austin Butler) towards leadership. Operating as an exposition dump for those who didn't remember the first film is Irulan (Florence Pugh), nominally taking up her chronicling duties from the book (her entries marking the start of every chapter), while her father, the Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), quietly ruminates on the implications of his plan to eradicate the Atreides perhaps failing.This is one of those stories that I know so well, that I kind of assume that everyone knows. And yet, Dune, for all it's popularity among scifi nerds, isn't the grand cultural touchpoint it's sometimes made out to be. Its influences are strong and wide, but the actual story knowledge isn't.Anyway, now's the time to talk about some creative choices. The first that screams out to me is how much more stylized visually the film is. The film opens with a scene of Harkonnen troops attacking the Fremen in the desert, and Villeneuve uses a partial eclipse as an excuse to bathe the entire scene in a deep orange. It's really nice to look at. I've been curious about the black and white segments in the trailers since I've seen them, and the explanation is that Geidi Prime has a black sun making it so that outside just looks like that. Knowing more from the books, I'd say that the whole Harkonnen look is something I'd attribute more to the Bene Tlielax, but it's at least interesting to see.There's a heavy emphasis on the Bene Gesserit and their breeding program in here, which I appreciate. I think that most heavily gets highlighted in the inclusion of Lady Margot Fenring (Lea Seydoux), a Bene Gesserit sent to Geidi Prime to seduce Feyd, secure his bloodline, and learn how to manipulate him should certain probabilities arise. She is very briefly seen in a modified form in the Sci-Fi Channel series, but otherwise she's never made an appearance in an adaptation. Although, unless Villeneuve is planning on using material from the sequel novels written by Brian Herbert (please no), Lady Fenring shouldn't be making any more appearances, making this feel like something of a dead end that still manages to provide some nice detail in terms of worldbuilding.And that leads me to the editing. I like how much detail gets brought in to help fill out the world (universe) of Dune, but there are some places where the film feels too fast. Take, for instance, the jump from Paul and Chani sitting on a dune watching a wormrider in the distance, Chani explaining to Paul that he'll never become a rider because he's not really Fremen. Cut ahead to about fifteen minutes later in screentime, there's been no mention of Paul training or anything, and now it's time for Paul to ride his first worm. Time has obviously passed, and this feels like the instance of a cut scene that was deemed unnecessary. However, considering how much time gets dedicated to Fenring's seduction of Feyd, it makes you wonder if the priorities were in total alignment when cutting the film down to its current length.So, Paul stays in the northern parts of Arrakis to lead the small revolt of the Fedaykin fighters against the Harkonnen while Jessica, pregnant and having become the Fremen's Reverend Mother through the changing of the Water of Life from poison into a harmless drink (no orgy in this mostly sexless adaptation), a process that awakens her unborn daughter, Alia, into consciousness. Gonna be honest, Jessica talking to Alia outloud is great. It's just the right kind of funny in this universe. Anyway, Jessica becomes a fanatic in the pursuit of Paul's legend as the Mahdi, the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World, while Paul resists it. If I remember correctly, this is something of a complete reversal where Paul easily fell into the legend to help him fight while Jessica saw it as something of a survival mechanism, an unfortunate path she had to take to stay alive. I don't mind this change because Furgeson as a madwoman is great to watch.Things escalate. The Emperor must come to Arrakis. There is a showdown, and that showdown is great. It reminded me of the epic ending to James Cameron's Avatar, a movie I have no great love for but which, I cannot deny, has a freaking awesome final act action sequence. Atomics, worms, giant spaceships, it all comes together in an action and special effects extravaganza that Villeneuve manages with aplomb. It's great fun.Now, Chani. Chani is given extra prominence, and I really don't like how they did it. She is one of the Fremen who does not believe in the Lisan al-Gaib, and she sticks to that belief through everything she witnesses. As Paul is presenting all of the signs, as Chani herself is becoming part of the prophecy that she rejects through literal actions, she not only resists, but she fights back against it. It's so out of place, and it goes through to the end of the film. Sure, Herbert having Chani blithely accept that the love of her life is going to marry an imperial princess for power was always a bit thin, but turning the ending of the film into watching her pouting is just wrong.The story of Dune is Paul going from boy to man to leader to godhead. It's not Chani being mad that Paul is going from boy to man to leader to godhead. Ending on her was a mistake.Anyway, it's a spectacle. I think it gets the heart of Herbert's message right. It mixes things up to some degree and to not entirely successful effect. As an adaptation of Dune, I think the Sci-Fi miniseries is probably the best, but as a filmed experience, this is the more exciting and complete of the three attempts."," Spectacle"
"47","Dune: Part Two","averagedeveloper","9/10","10 March 2024","Dune part two is a very good movie. It is a masterpiece in terms of visuals, stage designs, use of sound, acting, and the subtext it adapts from the book. It is perhaps the best movie that Hollywood has offered us in recent years, made by the most qualified people. But there is some flaws, even though the voices of people trying to say it are silenced due to the hype that is raging around. Still, I can also say that it is the most deserved hype I have ever seen.The film has two major issue that are related to each other. The first is that the ending of the film is rushed, as if the budget or screen time has run out. The film moves like it jumps from scene to scene without allowing us to enjoy the final climax moment. Thus, the scary sardaukar we saw in the first movie become meaningless. It's a bit like the last season of Game of Thrones here, there is a pacing problem. Honestly, I suspect this feeling was because I was so enthused by the quality of the film at the end so I went crazy for seeing more and more.The second problem is Alia. I understand the difficulty of staging Alia. That's why it was decided to deviate from the book and keep her in the mother's womb throughout the movie. This is a reference that spoils the pacing aspect of the movie, which is smooth except for the last act. While what we see from Paul's and Jessica's experiences is meaningful if it is spread over timeline, this reference point forces it all to have happened in five or six months.It's a problem that shouldn't even be mentioned, but the fact that the Fremen's battle uniforms did not resemble Paul's visions in the first movie made me a little bitter.Dune is a masterpiece in many senses, especially cinematographically. In fact, what the source story says about people, its subtexts and world fiction are amazing. I haven't been this completely immersed in a movie in a long time. I loved how they changed Chani's story arc and gave her a personality, and I loved how they showed Jessica's role more clearly than in the book. I loved how they made the character of Feyd more meaningful as his place in the grand scheme of things.So, it is not free from some flaws. Still, it is such a good movie that, while you normally get bored watching a movie over and over again, I love this movie even more by watching it over and over again."," It's a cinematographic masterpiece, I hadn't come across a movie that would make me want to watch it over and over again for a long time, until today"

Where in the book his little sister kills the Baron in the film Paul takes the honor of doing so. Also the fact that Chani is not supporting Paul for taking the hand of the Emperor's daughter, didn't have a child with him yet and actually goes her own way makes it hard to get a good start for the inevitable third movie that has to come. As a movie it was a great experience though. The action is great and the storytelling just as well. I personally wished that they sticked to the book till the end. Part one definitely did follow the book... part two also till the midst of the film. Still I strongly recommend to watch it... it is a must-see movie and ranks as one of my alltime favorites already."," Great adaptian of the first book (but not perfect)"

I only saw Christopher Walken as Christopher Walken.And I might be the only person on Earth who finds Florence Pugh to be the epitome and definition of BLAND.

I can only assume that is to set up a continuation of the Dune novels. So if the pacing and climax and ending all feel wonky to you, that is the best explanation I can give to you in your time of cinematic need.Otherwise, the film is entertaining for its length.

The set pieces, the cinematography, the use of visual effects and lights, the sound design and music, all, absolutely amazing and almost literally stunning!But then? I'm not really seeing much after that. As I have not read the books, this movie was a total mystery to me. There's barely any dialog--at least not any that would explain anything what's going on at all. The world and the technology etc just doesn't make much sense to me.None of the characters are particularly interesting, to be honest. They don't really have that much personality to them, and even if they did, they didn't really make me care about them all that much.I don't know, I'm a bit conflicted, it wasn't a bad movie and, as I said, it was entertaining and visually mesmerizing, but it lacked the depth that I was expecting of a world this size and this rich with lore and history. Maybe the movie makers assumed everyone has read the books? As someone to who the world is not familiar at all, it just seems rather confusing and strange. I feel like they just focused on making it as visually awesome as they can (in which they arguably succeeded), but left the story on the pages of the books."," Am I the only one who's not seeing it?"

Exchanging inner monologs with fictional languages, minor and unique adaptations to content to suit this storyteller's view point. I am always intrigued to see how screen writers bring a new outlook to an old favorite. While there is a 3 hour version of the 1984 adaptation of the novel and rumored to be a 6 hour somewhere in the cosmos, I truly hope they continue this one as they have begun to retell the novel. They have done a more than fair job so far and would expect to see at least an additional two films make their way to the big screen."," Hoping to see more"
"52","Dune","lika_key","7/10","1 December 2021","The hardest part about watching Dune is anticipating that viewing. Not falling into the trap of high expectations is a challenge at the level of survival in the Arrakian sands.No one could doubt that a sci-fi legend was just born. Movie is fascinating and epic. Perfectly made in terms of picture (insanely beautiful to behold), sound (Zimmer is genius once again) and atmosphere (thanks Herbert for universe and Villeneuve for such quivering re-creation).But... After movie I returned home with a slight smack of disappointment. The visual world is let down by its storytelling. Director is too keen on creating the atmosphere and details of the world, forgetting about the characters and emotional content.Insufficiently written characters with whom it is difficult to empathize (for non readers) with what is happening in the film.The film spends so much time trapped in expository sands that it show us preciously little amount of actual drama or character evolution.So I, as reader, felt the superficiality of the film script and the lack of adequate presentation for viewers who are not familiar with the text of the novel.Also.. don't know how to explain it... Movie kind of was two and a half hour connection to a story that will happen sometime later, in other films that no one even has yet started filming and, if the first part fails, will never be filmed! The film is scripted as if it were not an epic 200 million blockbuster, but the pilot of some tv series. Although no: even those are more independent.Elements of the setting are not yet story.. and Villeneuve just does not have it. Dune shows too well what happens when the structure of the novel is not adapted to the screen, but is left almost untouched (even though it was nice to catch almost literal quotes etc).The result is an impressive structure, a rich and lively fantasy world that spreads too far in breadth but does not hold its shape in any way.Also I sooo do not like comparation of Dune to Lord of the ring. Some people compared it to Fellowship.. But!! If these films were really synonymous, then the first part of LotR would have ended with the council of Elrond in Rivendell, when Frodo just signed to become courier delivery to Mordor!In the end... It is a technically perfect blockbuster, faithful to the original adaptation, voluminous epic, something deeper than just entertaining sci-fi, but storyless plot and deepless characters leaves you with the feeling of almost 3 hours spent on nothing happening."," A slight smack of disappointment..."

He missed the plot through, let's just say, the art.To explain why I loved the movie so much, I had him watch BOTH the Lynch and Syfy Channel versions of the movie.

"59","Dune","howls_castle","5/10","29 September 2021","Dune is a troublesome novel with a lot of politics involved, it's basically a re-writing of the old ""lawrence of arabia"", a trained guy freeing desert(ed) people from tyranny. Frank herbert had worked as a political journalist and knows the history of middle east and had built the dune legacy over it with few touches of things like melange (petroleum) that controls universe (earth), sandworms and all the little extras.I feel like most of the movie is covered with over-reacting of duncan, lady jessica, chani, vast scenery, little to none converstations and over-looked part of historical references.It might be fun to watch but probably i will forget it in a few days. Maybe the second part will fool me."," another attempt wasted **spoilers**"
"60","Dune","nomcarver","6/10","26 October 2021","Dune is a film based on Frank Herbert's 1965 Sci-Fi novel. Directed by Denis Villenueve, it focuses on building a story and immersing the audience in the desert world of Arrakis. I intentionally didn't read the book or watch David Lynch's 1984 adaptation of the story. This way, I went in with an open mind. I was immediately sucked into this universe. While it was very complex, Villenueve did an excellent job of educating the audience on what this world is like throughout the 2.5 hour course of the movie. Like many of his films, Dune was a very slow movie, which helped to put the spotlight on not only the story, but stellar performances by Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson. Jason Momoa was surprisingly great as well, adding a much-needed energetic spirit to the mood. His strong relationship with Paul Atreides (Chalamet's character) was clear from the start. Hans Zimmer delivered as usual, with another fitting soundtrack that with the atmosphere of each and every scene. While Dune has many upsides, it did fall a little flat for me. Villenueve put so much emphasis on building a story and setting up a second film that it felt like that's all it was. If you're looking for exciting action sequences, you won't find them here. If you're looking for a climax, you won't find it here. I was probably more disappointed than many viewers since I didn't actually know before watching that this was only part 1, so I was expecting a big finish, though it quickly became clear that wouldn't happen here. None of the villains played a large role in the film. It seemed like they were there because they had to be, but they didn't do anything. This was the case with many characters introduced around the 2 hour mark, including Zendaya's character. Their sole purpose in the film was to provide a smooth transition to part 2. At the end of the day, Dune is probably the longest first half of a film I've ever seen. It did a great job setting up part 2, so I'm hoping, as is everyone else, that it comes. You'll be left wanting more with this movie. It's still hard for me to think that they created such a beautiful and engaging world, but I feel like I didn't get even close to enough. If you like Villenueve's slow-burn films, and are okay with there not being a climax or ending, you may love Dune. As for me, I'll be waiting for part 2."," Immersive but Incomplete Story"

"69","Dune","grafer-den","7/10","25 September 2021","I'll say right away that I didn't watch the 1984 film, like the 2000 series. Or maybe it's worth it, by the way. Also did not read the novel on which these films and series are based. Therefore, I really have nothing to compare with. Thus, I do not pretend to be an expert judgment. Rather, there will be purely my subjective impressions.The first thing I want to note is that the film turned out to be really worthy. Good acting by Chalamet and other actors, magnificent landscapes, beautiful scenes, pleasant music, a touching story - this and much more you can see in ""Dune"", which is going to the cinema right now.This rarely happens to me, but this film directly interested me with its story - a plot written on the basis of the book. I wanted to figure out what's what.As a separate plus, you can highlight some lengthy scenes just to the extent to reveal their meaning. It can be seen that there is no unnecessary haste; that everything, as it were, is called upon to talk about something. A subtle storytelling style that pleases. The director lets us know that he really believes in what he does.As a separate plus, you can highlight some lengthy scenes. They are tightened exactly to the extent to reveal their meaning. It can be seen that there is no unnecessary haste; that everything, as it were, is called upon to talk about something. It's a subtle style of storytelling that pleases. The director lets us know that he really believes in what he does.But a lot of things in the film didn't go well for me. To begin with, it's fantastic. Maybe I'm just not a fan of science fiction, but still. There are legendary films by J. Lucas - ""Star Wars"", in which there is no less fiction. By the way, ""Dune"" is quite reminiscent of the stellar trilogies. But this film falls short of them. It only lasts until the last trilogy shot by Abrams.You still feel some kind of clownery - plastic costumes, Oscar Isaac, who starred in the Abrams trilogy, Zenday - in ""Spider-Man"", Jason Momoa - in ""Game of Thrones"". It can be seen that they picked up a little from everywhere. Extra poses, the pseudo-grandeur of what is happening, the far-fetched greatness of the heroes are visible. Somehow, at the level of feelings, it becomes clear that this could not have happened in real life. I'm not talking about new planets or the abilities of the characters, but about some seemingly trifles: their gestures, their manner of behaving and saying something, and the like. This pseudo-epic, unfortunately, almost completely pierced the entire modern cinema, and ""Dune"", alas, could not completely become an exception in this regard. I hope that I am now expressing myself quite clearly, because, in my opinion, this is just a disaster - all this obvious bombast, pretentiousness, superficiality, ""costume"", ""super-heroism"". Not that the entire film is saturated with this, but it is not without it.As for the plot
1. I can hardly imagine how you can live for centuries on a desert planet.2. I don't understand how you can just take and disobey the order of the emperor and attack the planet from which you should have departed?3. Why would a traitor try to kill someone to whom you betray someone? Why try to kill the protagonist first and then promise to protect him?4. Why would Baron Vladimir (keck) try to kill his own daughter? Well, that's all right. Why promise the witch not to touch her and her son, and then take them prisoner and try to take the devil knows where?I'm really unclear why there are so many artificial plot twists? It's noticeable! Naturally, when you write a novel / script for a film, you need to come up with something, but where to sculpt something so hard? Maybe, of course, I just misunderstood something, but even so - it looks too complicated - false. If the picture turned out to be too pompous, then the meaning of this picture is too fake.This is roughly how, in my humble opinion, things are with Dune.Despite its many flaws, there is something about the film that is catchy. Some kind of philosophizing, always relevant. Some kind of desire to give hope to people, something like that. In a word, I will hope that Dune 2 will be better. :) Although I understand that most likely it will not. But if not, then it will be something like the same stars of Abrams, nothing more.7 out of 10."," Is Harry Potter the Chosen One?"

"88","Dune","felipeandrescinema","10/10","12 December 2021","On several occasions over the last few months I have expressed my great devotion to ""Dune"", the new film by ambitious director Denis Villeneuve, he has directed major critically acclaimed films such as ""Blade Runner 2049"", ""Prisoners"", ""Arrival"", among others more. The choice of this director for this ambitious project is one of the most successful because he has expressed his love for the Frank Herbert novel for a long time.The story places us in Arrakis, where Duke Letto (Oscar Isaac) and Laddy Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) lead the government of this planet, located within the constellation of the Navio Argo. On the other hand, we have the son of this prestigious family called Paul Atreides (Timotheé Chalamet), heir to the command of this planet, this character has the ability that when he is asleep, he has visions about the bleak future that awaits Dune for the feared claw of the Harkonnen, the tyrannical family that wishes to possess these lands to become owners of a powerful drug known as Melange, a psychotropic species that can improve mental capacity and preserve the quality of life for a longer time, some beings can acquire psychic powers and the ability to access memories belonging to past generations.In short, this movie has made me fall in love once again with the science fiction genre, replicating the great success of sagas from decades past such as ""Star Wars"", ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter"". Another great prestige that this film has is to cover political issues such as the possession of territories, wealth, the health system and the decline of the rulers. It also projects an ambitious dynamic of images, lights, clothing and landscapes that fill the most demanding viewer with satisfaction. The dark way of telling the story is another of its great attributes, it takes advantage of the situations put on the screen as a great opportunity to express the tense situation that exists within this universe."," RIDICULOUS"

It was really good and both my wife and my son who have not read the book, shame on them, thought it was a great movie. Now we are looking forward for the rest of the book to be filmed."," Beautiful production, less than perfect script"

It need to contain at least 150 characters."," Denis Villeneuve is a modern sorcerer in Sci-Fi!"

"97","Dune","vjnambu","10/10","29 September 2021","I knew about this film when I heard that my favorite composer hans zimmer voluntarily dropped tenet to work on this film and I was wondering what's great about this. Then i read that its based on a classic sci-fi political novel which gave inspiration for star wars and game of thrones. Then its lineup of ensemble cast also made me curious for this film two years back. Then covid came and i stopped going to theatre for more than a year. Also this became wb same day same date release date for 2021 so, i was looking forward to see it at home. But when it released this week in my country, I thought to give it a shot in theatres. Hence, dune is my first film in theatre post pandemic.Talking about the film, I was thoroughly engaged and thrilled thanks to hans zimmer's score obviously. Its clearly evident how passionate he was for this film by hearing his score. Sound effects were terrific, which i wouldn't have got of i saw it at home. The cast were great but I was not in awe of anyone except jason mamoa. I felt disappointed of them wasting bautista.Film ends on an incomplete note for a sequel, but I wonder whether we would get to see it in future or not, if it does not perform financially well. We know how wb ruin director's work recently. Also the director should have simultaneously start shooting for the second part too for continuity.On the whole, watch dune is a must watch in theatres. Find a best theatre near you and witness this masterpiece."," It's a cinematographic masterpiece, I hadn't come across a movie that would make me want to watch it over and over again for a long time, until today"
"98","Dune","rajinmorar","10/10","13 December 2021","Dune is a movie that completely immerses the viewer in its world, story, characters and mythology. A sci-fi/fantasy film of this magnitude has not been seen since the Lord of the Rings trilogy.On an audio and visual level the film is simply breathtaking, with excellent cinematography, visual effects and a booming score. In spite of the slower pace I was completely riveted just following the story, political drama and learning about the world.There are a great many characters here, each of them given moments to shine. None felt unnecessary. Certainly it seems as though we haven't seen much of Paul and his story, but the setup is intriguing. While the ending is somewhat abrupt, and lacks the impact that one might hope for, this is a fantastic start to what will hopefully become a great sci-fi saga."," Great adaptian of the first book (but not perfect)"
"99","Dune","masonsaul","10/10","24 October 2021","Dune (part one) is a phenomenal epic that's truly transcendent, thrilling, extremely engaging, and emotional whilst also feeling extremely unique and different even though multiple adaptations already exist. Despite a slightly abrupt ending, the conclusion remains really satisfying because there's still a clear journey completed in this chapter.Despite the epic and complex proceedings, Timothée Chalamet is a surprisingly empathetic protagonist who grounds the film with an incredible lead performance that humanises Paul by showing how overwhelmed he is by this forced destiny. He's supported by the always excellent Rebecca Ferguson and a never better Jason Momoa.There's no weak links in this impressive cast with Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, and Sharon Duncan-Brewster all giving great supporting performances. Stellan Skarsgård is a terrifying villain whose emotionless reactions to his own sinister schemes are just pure evil.Dennis Villeneuve's direction is superb, it's gorgeously composed with cinematography by Greig Fraser that's truly breathtaking and makes everything feel massive. It's extremely well paced thanks to a first 90 minutes that does all the groundwork so that final hour can just go. The CG is consistently really impressive and the music by Hans Zimmer is perfect and so unique."," It's really good. But not convinced by some of the cast."
"100","Dune","GabriellaPP99","10/10","8 August 2023","What a spectacle of stunning visuals and performances. The actors nailed every single character and the desert for the 1st time didn't suffocate me.I love the family dynamics and how they will and still destroy each other for power; and appreciated the focused approach on one group/family. Although I am excited to mee the dessert family in the sequel.Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides is exceptional. Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto was so perfect, that i cannot even imagine another actor in that role.Denis Villeneuve has given us one of the greatest sci-fi flicks ever, And to have watched it on the big screen was the only way. Each scene is carefully crafted and with a score that elevates the film.WATCH DUNE - and get ready for the sequel."," Am I the only one who's not seeing it?"
