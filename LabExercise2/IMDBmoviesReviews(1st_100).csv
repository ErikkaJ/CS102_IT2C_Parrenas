"1","Road House","johnnyhbtvs27","5/10","22 March 2024","One of the great things about the original Road House was seeing Dalton clean house and improve the bar bit by bit. That is severely lacking here with next to no time spent in the actual Road House and barely any screen time is given to the people at the bar. One of the highlights of the Swayze movie was him getting to know the staff and getting rid of the bad elements at the bar. Nothing of the sort goes on in this movie.Jaoquim de Almeida is wasted as the sheriff and has little to do while Daniela Melchior has less of a role than Kelly Lynch had in the original if that was possible.The movie's saving grace is Jake Gyllenhaal who is clearly having a lot of fun in the role and has good chemistry with an OTT Conor McGregor in the movies best moments. Best stick to the original cult classic.(Glad to see Arturo Castro's Moe live, by far and away the best character in the whole movie)."," Road House 2024"
"2","Road House","SaidNDone","4/10","22 March 2024","""Road House"" feels like the highest budget 'made for TV' movie ever. Despite the money thrown at it, blockbuster director, and casting of Jake Gyllenhaal the movie overall falls completely flat with awful dialogue, uninteresting characters, and a storyline so thin you can see through it.The only positive about this movie is there were some very creative shots in the fight scenes, but even those were relatively uneven. And Connor McGregor was given far too much (poorly written) dialogue which combined with his vapid delivery takes you right out of the movie.Overall it feels like ""Road House"" was the product of someone giving a 13 year old boy absolute control of a Hollywood production. The upside to this is the chaotic mess they left behind is somewhat entertaining."," Flat"
"3","Road House","MartynGryphon","4/10","22 March 2024","If there's anything good to say about the 2024 remake of Road House, is that it will get people reaching for the classic 1989 movie to cleanse the palette and the more people who watch the original the better, as it is simply a brilliant film.Sadly, I can't say the same about this steaming pile of double deuce I have just witnessed. Is it even a remake? The similarities between the two are sparse. The main character is a bouncer named Dalton and he's hired by a bar owner to 'bounce'..... that's it, the only thing that would even make you think this was a remake.Missouri is replaced with Florida, mullets are replaced with bullet heads and actors are replaced with Conor McGregor and Billy Magnussen.With the occasional exception, (and I mean VERY occasional), remakes always fail. A lot of the time it's because they are being judged, at times unfairly, against the original. Others are simply bad movies trying to cash in on an illustrious name. 2024's Road House definitely falls in the latter category.In 1989, the Double Duece was a bar that Dalton was hired to clean up because of the trouble makers that frequented it, the fact that the entire town was being run by a crime kingpin running a protection racket. Is just an extra problem he encounters and has to deal with.In 2024, Dalton is hired BECAUSE of the crime kingpin, who wants to demolish the bar to realise his his real estate ambitions and Dalton isn't told about this until he runs foul of the goon squad sent to intimidate the bar and its patrons.At least in the Double Duece there was usually reasons fights broke out. In the Florida Road House, people seem to pick fights because the guy next to him was turning oxygen into carbon dioxide too loudly.To be fair to Jake Gyllenhaal, he does turn in a good performance given what he has to work with and he is the best thing in the entire movie. However, one thing is unforgivable, the CGI/AI action, it looks fake, cheap and takes you out of that reality instantly.The character of Dalton has also been changed. Patrick Swayze's Dalton was good man, firmly in control of his emotions and attitude to life, spirituality and clinical in his profession. Gyllenhaal's Dalton is not even a bouncer to start with, he's an ex UFC fighter hustling the illegal fight circuit for PIN money who falls into 'bouncing' by chance and while occasionally getting involved in the action, he seems to be collecting $5000 a week for sitting down at the bar watching all the other 'bouncers' do the grunt work for him under his 'guidance'. He is also mentally disturbed and sometimes can't keep a lid on it. He is also suicidal...for about 2 minutes at the start, never to be mentioned again.To show how unhinged this new Dalton is, he plants a bomb on a boat that is moored to a yacht that his girlfriend is held hostage on, and then detonates it remotely when they're still on board. You see, explosions are funny things, they're unpredictable and Dalton would have had no way of knowing whether that yacht would sink in 10 minutes or 10 seconds, a hell of a risk to take with an innocent life.Now let's talk about two people I briefly mentioned earlier, Conor McGregor and Billy Magnussen. Jeez they are bad? McGregor is so over the top that any realism that this person could actually exist in real life is gone in a second. You've heard of over egging the pudding? Well here we have no pudding at all, just lots of egg.Magnussen is as equally bland as he is bad. Again, this may not be his fault and the blame can certainly be placed on the script, as in one scene, he is seen getting a shave on the stern of his yacht in choppy seas, and the barber is using a cutthroat razor of all things and this absolute idiot seems shocked that he's getting hacked to bits by the barber with every stroke. I mean what did he think was going to happen?2024's Road House is an OK action flick that suffers more for trying to pass itself off as a remake of a bonefide classic.....a bonefide classic I am now going to go and watch as it's always been a rewatchable favourite. However, I'm not going to be watching this version again anytime soon....if ever.Enjoy!"," lazy NOT Swayze"
"4","Road House","chenp-54708","2/10","22 March 2024","Was remaking Roadhouse necessary? Because this one was pretty dreadful. Sure, the original Roadhouse wasn't a perfect movie but its non-serious tone, charm between the cast, and the intentional over-the-top action worked well to create a charming 80s flick. However, this remake fails to understand what makes the original pretty good as this remake provides an uneven script, terrible dialogue, weak performances, and a tone that takes itself way too seriously.Doug Liman's direction is bland and uninteresting and some of the dialogue really feels like something written by ChatGBT. I love Jake Gyllenhaal but unfortunately, despite Gyllenhaal having a solid performance, he wasn't able to save the movie from falling down. Including some casting choices that are really off-putting.The non-serious and over-the-top charm has disappeared and it makes this remake boring and bland to observe. In the end, this remake stinks."," What's the point?"
"5","Road House","NicoleM1","4/10","22 March 2024","Casting felt very forced which pulls you out of the story. Jake does a good job. Some of the fighting scenes were interesting. You could tell this was a very new Hollywood update of a classic movie. Some of the dialogue needed work.McGregor was also an odd choice. His permanent smiling expressions and him walking like he had hemorrhoids was very hard to move past. Sometimes you couldn't understand what he was even saying.Overall the movie was fun and if youre looking for a time killer its an okay option but I would probably just stick to the classic movie where the story and characters feel less contrived."," Forced Casting"
"6","Road House","Tweetienator","3/10","21 March 2024","Well, that was a trip, but not in a good way - the movie starring Patrick Swayze is not a masterpiece, but compared to this one, it is a masterpiece of entertainment of the highest order... This remake or reimagining or whatever it is, is just bad in every aspect. There are no likable characters, just some random violence, and the rest is just a bunch of heart- and soulless stuff. My little advice for you: if you don't know the original one, watch it. You'll get better music too. If you already know the original one, watch it again. I usually like Jake Gyllenhaal and some of his works (Nightcrawler, Prisoners, Jarhead, to name a few), but even he just looks like a dead clone of a clone of a clone and gives a very bored performance. At least, that was my impression. Avoid."," Crumbles Quick and Fast"
"7","Road House","westbayou","7/10","30 March 2024","Ok fact: remakes suck.Going into this, I wanted to hate it. Remake of an 80's classic and Jake G? Recipe for disaster. But..... this is a remake in name only. Fresh story, the only connection to the original is he's a bouncer for hire. I'll admit it, this stands up on its own.For lack of anything better to watch I gave this a shot. Color me surprised but I enjoyed the heck out of it. No agenda, just an old school action movie. Now the AI/CGI was nothing short of terrible, but if you look past that this movie embodies the old school Western movies it clearly mimics (and references several times, a bit on the nose).Was I entertained? Yup. Was it Oscar worthy? No, but I'll take entertaining over Oscar Worthy every time.Give it a shot, you may just enjoy yourself."," I wanted to hate this....."
"8","Road House","S-John-hall","3/10","22 March 2024","The film is beyond terrible and the acting even from Jake Gyllenhaal seems off, The dialogue is beyond terrible to the points where Jake Gyllenhaal asked (in the movie) is roadhouse, two words or one. I really wouldn't bother a very disappointing remake and to have it called roadhouse and the bar actually be a beach house on a beach is beyond confusing..The CGI and fight scenes don't seem to work. I don't know why they're used so much CGI for the fight scenes to the point where Conor McGregor doesn't even look like his punching Jake Gyllenhaal. The whole film just felt unnecessary and if Jake Gyllenhaal wasn't in it, I think it would've been classed as a B movie."," Started bad and got worse"
"9","Road House","NateWatchesCoolMovies","7/10","2 April 2024","So... the Road House remake. Am I allowed to say that I liked it as much as the original? I only saw the Swayze one for the first time last year and really enjoyed, but I also really dug Doug Liman's recent update with Jake Gyllenhaal too, for different reasons. Jake himself is one of those reasons, he's breezy and effervescent as Dalton, disgraced ex MMA fighter relocated to the beautiful Florida Keys to defend a beachfront bar from relentless goons. The Keys setting is also another reason why I liked this a lot, it adds so much laidback atmosphere and picturesque scenery as backdrop for this simple, straightforward action flick that fills the shoes of the original adequately enough. I think that having a marauding meathead like Conor McGregor as the head goon was a bit of a misstep though; the guy is clearly not an actor and thinks he'll win over the screen by chewing more scenery than Gary Busey, but a modicum of restraint on his part might have kept his performance this side of the moon in terms of subtlety, and let other aspects flourish to the forefront. Sultry Daniela Melchior, smarmy Billy Magnusson and always terrific Joaquim De Almeida are good in supporting roles. I really liked Jake's performance here though; he adopts this laconic affability that hides a sickening darkness in his past, something he's always on the run from. The action is fearsome and often quite funny, the tone tropical and easygoing. My only gripe is it could have been a bit longer to flesh certain elements out and focused on Mcgregor's seething villain a tad less to pivot more over to other aspects the film has that it seemed to want to take more seriously. All in all a really good time and easily as enjoyable for me as the OG Roadhouse."," I liked it for what it was"
"10","Road House","masonsaul","7/10","22 March 2024","Road House is exactly what it needs to be. A self-serious yet simultaneously very silly modern day riff on the Western that's packed with testosterone, crunchy action and jokes in the most unexpected places. It feels like a streaming movie in some distracting ways but it still remains one of the better ones.Jake Gyllenhaal brings a natural intensity to Dalton as well as an impressive physical commitment. It's the possibility of his rage that he always keeps at bay that makes him so watchable in this role as he beats up his enemies and then makes sure they're okay before actually driving them to the hospital.From the moment he's introduced, Conor McGregor is definitely something. It's the kind of performance that's never boring and never good. Every single line is delivered in hilariously awful fashion and yet he's one of the best parts of the film as he takes a very generically unhinged villain and makes it his own.Doug Liman's direction certainly has a lot of energy as it alternates between fights in the first person, drone shots and simply getting as close as possible to the action. The fights themselves have a real weight to them with the heaviest blows really being felt however, some of the CG flourishes used to stitch them together distract rather than enhance."," So ridiculous in the best ways"
"11","Road House","garethwooduk","7/10","3 April 2024","Remakes... when you have iconic movies being remade its very hard to capture the essense that made the original movie a classic.I was very sceptical of a Road House remake, where Patrick Swayze with his coolness, sex appeal and ease was the perfect leading man making the 1989 an instant classic!2024, we have 'Jake Gyllenhaal' a Hollywood Actor with many movies to his bow, who I thought played 'Elwood Dalton' perfectly, looking the part physcially being a previous UFC fighter in the plot, had the perfect vibe with his perfect swager with his no nonsense attitude and fighting skills to match.His nemisis this time is 'Ben Brant' who is a rich kid looking after his Daddy's empire who isnt that frightening, unlike the original big bad 'Brad Wesley' keeping Patrick's Dalton on his toes.A movie that centres around a music bar being driven in to the ground by local gangs and trouble makers never seems to shine or rise from the ashes and only appears in a few shots.'Conor McGregor' well known fighter sent in as hired help was fun to watch with some great fight scenes with Dalton but not keen on this twisted mix of an Irish / Cockney & American accent felt gimmicky.Overall, I enjoyed more then I thought, just wished it played more hommage to the original, if a potential second comes in the works... More fights, Roadhouse featured more and Jake Gyllenhaal throwing a few extra punches with a better bad guy to match!"," Decenty enough remake..."

They made Conor McGregor into a ridiculous, maniacally grinning robot.I actually feel bad for Gyllenhaal who obviously trained hard for this disaster, and he has nothing to show for it.The original was no great masterpiece but at least it was fun to watch and it had a good story to it.

He really can't act, and just stomps around spouting cringe one liners that he can't pull off. You'd also expect at least his fight scenes to be good, but they weren't.With another actor in the Mcgregor role this could have been a great action movie.The fight scenes are hit and miss with some looking very fake with some bad cgi at times too.

"15","Road House","darapjohnson","6/10","27 March 2024","I don't understand the bad reviews for this. It's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and it's obvious literally from the very beginning that it's self-aware. It knows how to laugh at itself with its over the top fight scenes and at times bad and cheesy dialogue or even the constant wild music being played in the background. Even the way Conor Mcgregor walked and talked was not serious in itself. I mean come on, it's impossible to hate on a film like this. Sure, some movies that don't take themselves seriously can still be very bad, but this one was actually pretty alright if you don't compare it to the original or just go into it with lower expectations. I'd definitely recommend this as a fun popcorn action flick if you're bored."," Fun self-aware popcorn action flick"

Having said this though and as I was guessing a year or so ago, when I watched the sequel to the original movie: They really did a good job here.No idea why this was not released in cinemas - especially with the cast and of course the director at helm! And he wasn't too happy about that either. Yes there is quite a bit of CGi in this, especially in the fights. But I think it was well done. I didn't notice it too much - maybe if I had seen it on a bigger screen I would have? Who knows - maybe those who have.I don't think I would have minded too much! Better that way than people actually hurting each other - Jake said he did accidentally hit someone in the making of the movie - the other guy was a trooper though. The fights are fun, the characters are ""mental"" (in a fun way I reckon) ... especially the one ""played"" by Connor McGregor. I know a lot of people hate on him - but he seems to be himself - well maybe a bit bigger! Turned up to 11 as a famous movie was saying once. So while it may not count as actual acting - he is so over the top ... you have to love his ""performance"".

"20","Road House","FeastMode","8/10","21 March 2024","I find most streaming movies to range between mediocre and terrible. But every once in a while, one comes along that surprises me; one that understands what it means to entertain. Road House (2024) is the definition of entertaining.This is a highly enjoyable and fun action flick. It has a mostly light-hearted tone, but there are a few moments that demonstrate the seriousness; a few looks given by Gyllenhaal that chilled me to the bone.To continue on that topic, Gyllenhaal gives yet another phenomenal performance. He has this weird demeanor of someone relaxed, chill, and carefree. But there is always something more behind his eyes.The fight scenes are fantastic. I had my jaw dropped for extended periods. There are so many punches where they focus on letting us see the hit. I don't know how they did it so well.The other surprise is the humor. I full-volume laughed repeatedly, my favorite being the nice henchman. And it never feels random or forced. Most of the laughs aren't even jokes, but rather situational humor within the action.One last point of note, I want to thank these filmmakers for having the courage to go for an R-rating. It seems obvious for this type of movie, and for a movie that's not dependent on ticket sales. But I've seen too many movies, even streaming, that opt for the neutered version of their film. A few that come to mind: Rebel Moon, The Gray Man, Samaritan.I had a blast watching Road House. I think most people will love it.

What a performance!From his first fight scene where he slaps the heck out of some Florida fellas, I was hooked. Like going to the grocery store on a hot summer day cause you ain't got no ac, this movie rocks.The acting is phenomenal. The girl who works as a book store cashier and the lady who owns the road house and the one henchman guy who is always polite to Dalton and the rich guy's dad who is in jail.Now as with any classic movie remakes, everyone has their opinion and loves to compare the new one to the original. I can definitively say, this is definitely a remake but with its own take on the original source.Jack Gyllenhawl gives a unique take on the character Dalton. His portrayal of the classic character is like a ghost of the original; almost as if one too many people tried to put him in the corner and ain't no one put baby in the corner. He has the edgyness and moodyness of a teenager with divorced parents. He's got the physique of fight club Bread Pitt and the smile of a demonical cat.Go see it for yourself. Then go watch the original. Then get two monitors and play them both at the same time. You won't regret it."," Dalton Moves to Florida"

Had a good laugh and the main characters were good in their roles. Funny oneliners and some nice fights. Just watch it, it's different than the original but good and entertaining. McGregor was a nice add as eccentric fighter. Watched it on a lazy afternoon. Its worth a watch. For all you sour viewers, just turn it off and watch something else. If you want to turn off your brain and watch some good action movie, this is for you. If you're a fan of nonsense eighties style action movies watch it. You will not regret it.

It's everything what I thought it was going to be! Cheesy! Action packed! Over the top villain, which is portrayed by undoubtedly one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time, Conor McGregor. Who brings something this movie needed for sure.. Jake Gyllenhaal definitely had some big shoes to fill in this one But he didn't disappoint! It's just one of those movies you can sit down with the family and be entertained for a couple of hours no need to compare to the original movie because there's no comparison between the two the Original will forever and always be Gold!

Character - but this being a remake! I assume many have fond thoughts of the original! And I really liked it too (a bit more than this one). Having said this though and as I was guessing a year or so ago, when I watched the sequel to the original movie: They really did a good job here.No idea why this was not released in cinemas - especially with the cast and of course the director at helm! And he wasn't too happy about that either. Yes there is quite a bit of CGi in this, especially in the fights. But I think it was well done. I didn't notice it too much - maybe if I had seen it on a bigger screen I would have? Who knows - maybe those who have.I don't think I would have minded too much! Better that way than people actually hurting each other - Jake said he did accidentally hit someone in the making of the movie - the other guy was a trooper though. The fights are fun, the characters are ""mental"" (in a fun way I reckon) ... especially the one ""played"" by Connor McGregor. I know a lot of people hate on him - but he seems to be himself - well maybe a bit bigger! Turned up to 11 as a famous movie was saying once. So while it may not count as actual acting - he is so over the top ... you have to love his ""performance"". And I mean that without being funny or anything.Don't put baby (Jake) in the corner - I know different movie! And this has more than enough things you can quote too - plus enough nods to the original ... showing its love for it ... so do the same and embrace it! This can be fun, if you just let go - don't overthink it ... the script was not written that way."," Road or House movie?"
"33","Road House","JK-WhatsUpWeirdoPodcast","8/10","20 March 2024","Road House is a wee bit too long but it's pretty f'n fun. Rumors of cgi fighting are untrue, they clearly put a TON of work into all training involved. Jake Gyllenhaal has never been hotter, Conor McGregor is unhinged. You truly aren't ready for the way they intro Conor into the movie. Lol .. His entire performance is so quintessentially him.If you accept this as a reimagining of Road House in its own universe I think you'll have a blast. It's funny, crazy, action packed, and a great time. Looks beautiful and expensive too. The boat sequence near the end is bonkers, that's worth the whole movie."," It's as fun as you want it to be"

It's a remake of Road House which was a somewhat cheesy 80's action flick. Giving it under 5 stars is just unfair and almost as if you're trying to counter the high ratings. It's no 10, but 2? Come on...This updated version is more, not totally, plausible, but still just a movie made for entertainment. I don't think they were going for Oscars. Most all the actors were pretty good. Jake Gyllenhaals character was clever and usually had something witty to say. Conor's (""Knox"") acting was decent. Remember, he's used to entertaining in the ring, but he's not a trained actor. However, they could have backed off on his insane smiling and not had him walk so odd in every scene. Unless I missed it, I would have liked more on his back-story. Was he former MMA, UFC? I don't believe he was as the main people didn't seem to know him. But how could hold up against, and sometimes get the edge on, a former UFC champ? A movie is only so long and can't be as thorough as a series so I accept it for what it was and really enjoyed it. I'd go 7.5, but since that's not possible I rounded up."," Pretty good for what it was..."
"35","Road House","FeastMode","8/10","21 March 2024","I find most streaming movies to range between mediocre and terrible. But every once in a while, one comes along that surprises me; one that understands what it means to entertain. Road House (2024) is the definition of entertaining.This is a highly enjoyable and fun action flick. It has a mostly light-hearted tone, but there are a few moments that demonstrate the seriousness; a few looks given by Gyllenhaal that chilled me to the bone.To continue on that topic, Gyllenhaal gives yet another phenomenal performance. He has this weird demeanor of someone relaxed, chill, and carefree. But there is always something more behind his eyes.The fight scenes are fantastic. I had my jaw dropped for extended periods. There are so many punches where they focus on letting us see the hit. I don't know how they did it so well.The other surprise is the humor. I full-volume laughed repeatedly, my favorite being the nice henchman. And it never feels random or forced. Most of the laughs aren't even jokes, but rather situational humor within the action.One last point of note, I want to thank these filmmakers for having the courage to go for an R-rating. It seems obvious for this type of movie, and for a movie that's not dependent on ticket sales. But I've seen too many movies, even streaming, that opt for the neutered version of their film. A few that come to mind: Rebel Moon, The Gray Man, Samaritan.I had a blast watching Road House. I think most people will love it. It may not be super deep, but it remembers how to entertain.(1 viewing, 3/20/2024)"," A streaming movie that knows what it means to entertain?!?!"

His opening scene of being completely nude in downtown Italy was perfect. The best way to describe this movie is to talk about how fun it is to watch. It's a blast. I'm honestly praying for a sequel. You won't be disappointed! The fight scenes might be the best choreographed scenes I've ever seen in a movie. The story is simple and fast paced as well.

"40","Road House","JerryrFlanagan","8/10","27 March 2024","It's okay, not too shabby. As someone who loves the 1998 version of Road House starring Patrick Swayze, Kelly Lynch, and Sam Elliott, I have to admit that the 2024 version is almost as good as the original. Believe it or not, Road House (1998) ranks as my second favorite movie ever, out of a total of 902 films that I have rated over the course of my adult life, spanning 40 years. Jake Gyllenhaal, known for his role as Dalton. His an ex-UFC fighter, that becomes a bouncer at a Road House in the Florida Keys. However, he soon realizes that this seemingly perfect paradise is not what it appears to be. Jake is an exceptional performer. One of my personal favorites is when he plays the main character in ""Prince of Persia"". I'm uncertain if that movie helped him secure a role in Road House 2024, but I strongly believe it did. His portrayal of the Prince of Persia in 2010 was truly remarkable. Another actor who really stood out for me in this film was Conor McGregor, portraying the character Knox. This individual excels in every aspect of his life, including UFC, marketing, interviews, politics, and now Hollywood movies. In this movie, his on-screen performance is phenomenal as the ultimate villain of the UFC, determined to annihilate anything and anyone in his path to achieve his ultimate objective. In this film, you can expect plenty of laughter, heartfelt humor, a portrayal of a family man with integrity, and some sexy moments to keep you engaged throughout its 120-minute runtime."," The 2024 version is almost as good as the 1998 version."
"41","Road House","18Buddha","8/10","27 March 2024","All I keep seeing is ppl cry n complain n whine that Conor Mcgregor made the movie bad and I personally disagree.The fact you see how wild n crazy Conor acts in real life and mixed with the fact he was a former 2 division UFC champion honestly made this role the Perfect one for him as hes wild, unpredictable n crazy & the part where he says to Jake ""Theres something wrong with you, Me Too"" I legit felt that line comin from Conor was so legit, as anyone who followed his journey n career would see his insane behaviours n crazy antics often seemed like he just couldnt control himself, like theirs just something wrong with him inside n he just lets it out raging, hence why he loves fighting so much even when rich.Someone said he acted like a grinning maniac lol? How else is a mercenary for a criminal group suppose to act ? Is their a road map blueprint? Or do you guys suppose they gotta act mysterious like they apart of a ninja clan? Or MI-6? They chose to have the mercenary portrayed as maniacal due to well he kills ppl for a living n probably enjoys it so im sure hes kinda looney for sure, next hes a skilled fighter so im guessing he fights quite alot n mix that with hes maniacal well it seems obvious he would behave more crazy as more fighting happens. If any other actor said the one liners he did I am sure u all wouldnt be so upset but Conor pulled off the lines very good for someone whois first time acting.Sure their was something I disliked and that was certain times they tried to cut the film length down so they opted to skip showing Conor beating up the minions n NPCS, but It would have put a bigger statement on his threat level if they actually showed it instead. I am sure they did this not only to save time but probably they feared Conor couldnt hold back on his punches cause I swear lots of times during this film I thought omg Conor really punched the guy foreal and thats what makes the fighting more legit & entertaining cause unlike actors playing the roles to fight, Conor legit is a dangerous fighter and many haters may laugh at this comment just cause he hasnt fought in a while but the fact is every single hater if stepped up to him to fight probs would be dead n Conor wouldnt break a sweat and thats why when u see someone whois not an actor do fight scenes n hes legit a real dangerous striker & u gonna be on the edge of ur seats wondering holy shiet did he hold back? Or did the director appease his star status so much that he let the stuntmans n extras get ass whooped for real.I didnt like the female lead love interest as she wasn't to great but on a side note I thought the minor character Moe was great! Infact I would watch a film if they made one on his character lol, a comedy film where hes always joining up different groups of ppl n ending up in bad n hilarious situations before having to pack his bag on a hobo stick n ride off into the sunset before joining another in his search for some friendly biker friends :P."," All these Conor-hatin Cry babies up in here lol"

It's got great quotes, some comic relief to chuckle at, McGregor looks absolutely goofy all the time but that's fantastic. Jake does a much better job than I anticipated in the role and has some great scenes of being non-chalant which are pretty funny. JH has sort of a soft voice but a hard face which carries callousness. The dialogue almost seems ad-lib as most of the actors seem so comfortable in their role, even the timid biker guy. The fight scenes are the same but different; the POV of Jake and Connor take a bit to get used to. RH has humor and emotion and some crazy improbable scenes but don't over-think; no diff than anything Jason Statham has done.

The acting is good, story is a lot of fun, fight scenes seem quite authentic, there's a love interest and it also tugs on the heart strings a bit. There are a few incredulous moments but compared to the latest mission impossible (2023) it was 10x less. If you don't like graphic and realistic violence I don't think this is for you.

If you love a '80s/'90s style action/fighting movie that does not take itself too seriously, this is absolutely for you.The fight scenes and the fight choreography were top-notch.

Am@zon has been trying to produce a new batch of movies and this is not a bad edition to the gang. The MMA crew, including a few flashings make some laughs but the best is not the cheesy lines by some picked out of a barrel actors, but Jake's delivery.

"50","Road House","dlancecarrington","8/10","23 March 2024","I'm a huge fan of the original Roadhouse, an over the top cotton candy classic film. I'm not sure it needed a remake. But, Gyllenhaal is game, as always, as the central figure, Elwood Dalton. He's an ex mma fighter with a dark past. He finds his way to the town of Glass Key, a small seaside town with too many unsavory characters looking for a good time and a fistfight. Just like the original film, it all plays out like a modern day western. The local baddie is trying to take over the town and a lone drifter comes along to stand up to the bully and all his baddies in tow.Unfortunately, there isn't much character development. For a movie with a 2 hour run time, it moves surprisingly fast. This is both good and bad. The original Roadhouse benefit from a great cast of peripheral performances. From Kelly Lynch to Sam Elliott to Ben Gazara. That movie managed to squeeze every bit of backstory without complicated the issue. This Roadhouse feels much too light for its own good. Gyllenhaal has to carry the weight of this movie, and he does the job. But, you come away wishing he had more to work with. The fights sequences are filmed well, albeit with a bit of CGI assistance. However, there are some set piece action scenes that feel out of place. And, there will be much talk about Connor MacGregor's film debut. Suffice to say it's equal parts scene stealing and scenery chewing bafoonery.The original Roadhouse filled a gap. It was entertainingly violent and trashy without leaving a bad taste in your mouth. It's the type of film you watch anytime you're scrolling late night for some to pass the time. It's comfort junk food at its finest. This new film leaves a taste in your mouth that's hard to identify. It's junk food that feels more like junk. Good, but not quite satisfying."," A new type of Dalton"

Tolkien said, and I quote: ""I dislike Dune with some intensity and in that unfortunate case it is best and fairest for the other author to remain silent and refuse to comment."" (Letter to John Bush, 1966), because it deals with violent and unnecessary themes for a story and novel that would potentially be one of the best in the world.Leaving aside the negative, it deals with quite innovative themes not common in current films (and books of the 20th century), which is why it deserves a good rating, in my opinion, in the face of all criticism."," About the book"

but this movie have some major problems
1.the movie don't have a soul and the narrative is bad and I cant fully connect with the story
it's like you just shoot the scenes and the characters cant deliver real emotions
it's fake emotions and you can see it clearly in scenes...
2.camera angels is way way bad
If you know about cinema you can see this things and its make you uncomfortable... for example take a look at lawrence of arabia and you get what I mean
3.cinematography is bad too(the way they light the scenes was different and the desert color and lights are bad too we talking about a big budget movie that compared to lord of the rings and its nothing like it
sure there are some cool shots and lightings and effects was awsome but when you see the big picture you wont get satisfied...
4.casting is goddam bad
there are some good cast in there like rebecca and josh
but paul and chani or fake emotions of javier(he is a good actor btw) was so bad I mean how you cant see this things in casting
you want famous people to promote your movie
I get it but a pick a good one not these...
5.people see big promotions all over the globe and they think themselves ok this is it this is the movie of our time but its not.. sure its the best movie of the year so far but compare to ratings its just not what I hoped for...
I love the first dune that denis created it was way way better than the second one I hope in the 3rd movie he change the way he created second dune...

It was most likely the best experience I've ever had watching a movie and I think it is a must watch for everyone. The cinematography was stunning, the performances were very good and the score by Zimmer is just unbelievable, it gives me chills every time and makes the epic scene significantly more epic. Paul's development in this movie reminds me a lot of Anakin in the revenge of the sith. He becomes really powerful and kills every one that stands in his way and I think seeing that power land in his hands makes this movie that much more satisfying. Also Austin Butler's portrayal of Feyd-Rautha was bone chilling. In every one of his scenes he looked so ready to take someone's head off and that kind of psychopathic villain alleviates a movie to a whole other level.Bravo Denis."," Long live the fighters!"

I'd say it's definitely worth watching on a big screen and it's definitely more enjoyable with real booming speakers. But my main two qualms with this movie were, number one: it was too long, three hours? We couldn't have shaved off like forty five minutes? I just don't want to be picking up my phone to check how much longer. Number two it left on another cliffhanger! I thought I had a realistic hope that this three hour sequel would nicely wrap up the series in a nice satisfying way. But it didn't. It left open ended with obvious intentions of a third movie, so great.All in all I'd say it's a cinematic triumph that was just lacking a little girth.

In both films you grow feelings for Paul and Chani and want to know more about there story. It'll always want you leaving more as it did me. We need Dune Messiah now and Children of Dune.

4. Nearly fell asleep several times.When I saw the first movie I was disappointed. It was only darkness, desert and a pretty bad story. Great pictures and sounds with good actors but the CGI was really crap actually. I went into the cinema with high expectations considering the great ratings it had gotten from all over the world. The movie was to long with for this kinda uneventful piece of work and I was really disappointed. The first movie was better than the second even though it didn't get a good rating from me.

"64","Dune: Part Two","wolfgangpeters-70447","8/10","11 March 2024","In contemplating the intricate web of power, politics, and fate woven within Dune , one cannot help but be drawn into a deep existential reflection on the nature of humanity and the universe. I am particularly struck by the themes of agency, determinism, and the interplay between individual will and external forces.The character of Paul Atreides, as he navigates the treacherous politics of the desert planet Arrakis, serves as a symbol of human ambition and hubris. In his quest for power and survival, Paul grapples with questions of free will and destiny, ultimately realizing the futility of attempting to control the course of events.The world of Dune is a complex and richly textured tapestry of cultures, religions, and ideologies, all vying for dominance in a universe governed by mysterious forces beyond mortal comprehension. The struggle between the powerful Houses, the enigmatic Bene Gesserit sisterhood, and the nomadic Fremen people underscores the constant flux of power and influence in a universe where nothing is certain.As the plot unfolds and alliances shift, ethical dilemmas and moral quandaries abound, challenging the characters and the audience to confront their own notions of right and wrong. The themes of sacrifice, loyalty, and betrayal are woven throughout the narrative, inviting us to ponder the nature of justice and the limits of moral responsibility.In conclusion, Dune 2 kick ass 15% more than the first one, I'll take it."," the power of Dune"

I mean , how can formidable emperor be this stupid to fall to this trap and just land where they want and not know the weather of the planet and refuse the advice to leave for orbit until the storm settled ,and what happened to letting the war begin and bringing peace ! And why would the duke wants this unpredictable nobody to be empire instead of the (clueless) old guy or his daughter!He would've accepted the job without being given this incentive!

"67","Dune: Part Two","gantulga-68703","6/10","3 March 2024","Let us be frankly honest here. Dune part 2 is visually astonishing piece with good touch from Hans Zimmer. But, when it comes to logic and moving the emotions, it was just mediocre film overall. It has a lot of unneccesary violence and unneccessary scenes. Plus it was kinda boring. Only CGI worms and miners battle scenes kept me awake. When it had a lot of potential of good stories and reasons, they choose to show us unneccessary violence and nonsense killings. As a huge science fiction fan, I was disappointed tbh. Who can we ask for the explanation of the dead man's sudden revival, Chani's helicopter, deathworms control etc. Most of the good science fiction movies leave at least a little bit of explanation, clue or anything. Well, perhaps I shouldnt ask why they were big fan of engaging in hand to hand combat when they had duper high technology??? You want to say because of armor shielding? Duh. As for the acting, Timothee was mediocre, Zendeya was perfect, Bardem was funny as hell. And, whenever Rececca Ferguson appeared, I wanted throw up or something. Others were not relatable or noticeable. Best movie since LOTR? Cmon. I go to cinema to be moved by emotions, not be shaked with effects."," Overrated! Only Mongolian deathworms keep it relevant"

Film adopted to rather not demanding viewer - landscapes and music is to replace content...if you are interested in good music as background and fine views its for you.

Which I did in the cinema. I have to say the directing in the desert was cool and the images were nice to look at, but other than that no.

"71","Dune: Part Two","southrnboy-76590","6/10","2 March 2024","Dune Part 2 missed the mark for me. While it is visually appealing, it lacks the narrative depth and intrigue present in the novel. The book presents a complex web of plots and machinations interwoven into one story; the movie is more akin to other sci fi spectacles, and leans into an action movie vibe, which tonally doesn't work with the source material. It's like it's trying to be both things at the same time, and as a result accomplishes neither.Many of the character arcs and storylines present in the novel are either heavily altered, or missing entirely. Naturally, a decent amount of this is to be expected whenever a narrative work is converted to film, but with Denis Villeneuve's Dune 2, the the changes are as numerous as they are baffling. Alia is never born in the film, and she doesn't kill the Baron. Paul does? (and the Emperor?) The introduction of Alia was perfect in book, and helps to revitalize the progression of events, keeping the story gripping and thought provoking. The movie on the other hand, spends an extortionate amount of time explaining the water of life, and exploring Jessica's new role as a Reverend Mother.In summary, Dune Part 2 is a visually appealing, narratively lacking, cinematic experience, which is refreshing when contrasted with many other recent films. Those that are new to the dune universe will likely be somewhat entertained, whereas fans of the books will probably be frustrated at the various alterations and changes."," Too different from the book"
"72","Dune: Part Two","jordanthan","9/10","4 March 2024","After many delays, it is finally time to experience the DUNE pill. Denis Villeneuve delivered his promise of fully adapting one of the most influentially dense sci-fi novels ever. Dune (2019) laid the groundwork, and now the sequel expands on everything established. The acting, music, cinematography, writing, visual effects, costumes, editing, audio mixing, and everything else about the film is astonishing. I can see decades' worth of passion laced in the filmmaking. If you're going to watch this film, find the closest theatre and experience in IMAX. I just hope Denis can go one more round for Messiah."," It was worth it"
"73","Dune: Part Two","altenhofkontakt","5/10","4 March 2024","The long-awaited sequel to Villeneuve's interpretation of Dune offers moviegoers outstanding cinematography, costumes and set designs. For an action-heavy movie, however, the film weakens in the choreography of the fights, where punches theatrically go nowhere and blows are thrown as if in a martial arts B-movie. But what is far more significant is the pale characterization and the sometimes outrageously banal, weak dialog (including the most pathetic declarations of love in recent film history). The movie oscillates between grandeur and patheticness. While at one point the director succeeds in staging something of philosophical greatness, the high flight repeatedly ends at low points such as the completely one-dimensional good-evil characterization. It has the absurdity of a running gag when a Harkonnen scoundrel slits the neck of an assistant who is merely correcting or warning him for the third or so time. Even sillier is the super-villain outfit worn by the terribly mad Harkonnen antagonist Feyd-Rautha during his vendetta on Arrakis - a reminder of the most banal Marvel films."," Ups and downs on the desert planet"

As with the first one, I felt, well... conflicted. Like eating too much of something decadent and rich yet left soon after feeling un-satisfied, a bit queezy and confused on how you are not so fulfilled by something that just moments ago gave you such great satisfaction. Honestly I don't know how to better describe the overall experience of seeing Denis Villeneuve's visually sumptuous vision of Frank Herbert's novel. It is a meal of empty calories.I could get into dissecting this for days, but why do that? Go see it for yourself and experience it. Then go home and watch David Lynch's 1984 version and feel even more confused, amused and downrightight satisfied with such unforgettableble momentsts like Sir Patrick Stewart with a mullet, the most terrifying over the top menacing floating fat man imaginable, a creepy Reverend Mother played by a 4 year old, an amazinging sound score, and yes... the holy grail...

"76","Dune: Part Two","AfricanBro","9/10","26 February 2024","Phenomenal stuff. I'll probably calm down tomorrow but right now my heart's beating like crazy and my brain's screaming it's a bloody masterpiece. This is one of the few movies that I didn't try to control my expectations beforehand and it still surpassed them in many ways.""Power over spice is power over all""- that kinda turned out to be a lie at the end. As The movie starts, I felt an immediate sense of tension through its score. It's a cinematic experience; I can't imagine feeling the same lying at home in bed, watching in headphones. The resonating vibrations as the sounds reverberate through the theater created an epic atmosphere.When Part One came out people said it was ""game of thrones in space"", I wasn't really taken by that as much, especially since people said the same about Apple TV's Foundation series. So I just enjoyed the movie as Dune and bore no comparisons. After watching part two however I see it; the world building, the politics, the epic grandeur of it all.However, the first half of Dune Part Two is pretty grounded and calm, delving into the lives of the Fremen. It almost feels like two distinct movies, the first half intricately setting the stage for the climactic third act and reinforcing character connections established in Dune Part One. Unlike the Part One's focus on lore, this movie is more devotion-driven, also resembling a political narrative, especially knowing of the hidden puppeteers behind the empire. The result appears to be an intricate web of schemes involving the empire, the witch-advisor women(can't spell their names lol), and the Baron's family. Despite the emperor's pulling the strings, the Baron's family still felt like main antagonist to me.The second half of the movie is where we see the epic scale of dune. The movies not quick paced but you couldn't tell, I was absolutely immersed in it.I absolutely loved the kind ""The mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi."" Theatre burst out in laughter. It felt weird, I wasn't expecting any humour. It's funnier than I expected. More lively than the first Dune movie. I'd already seen the Usul-worm-riding scene from the Dune Part One reopening bonus content. I was still just as excited and it didn't spoil a thing.The visual brilliance, as expected was stunning, elevating every aspect. The authenticity of the scenes made it feel as if characters were immersed in the environment, rather than merely placed against a green screen. I loved the portrayal of time passing through Paul's changing eyes; the longer he stays the bluer his eyes get. Despite how lively it is, the plot, while progressing at a measured pace, remains engaging, drawing attention away from its deliberate slowness. It has much more action, the battles were absolutely epic, I feel like they could have been longer but they still captivated me.Jessica disappears for a while, but just when I thought that, she showed up. Other than Paul and Zendeya, the rest of the cast doesn't really get as much screen time as you'd think. I loved the baby/embryo/featus scenes. Batista with no mask in the desert while his whole team's suited up was badass. I love him in darker roles, although I think some moments felt overly animated. But it gave an effective contrast to Austin Butler though, I couldn't wait to see what his character was like. Very fierce, intimidating and psycho. The girl shivering with the plate in her hands before the gladiator games made me chuckle. Butler did also sound like the baron at times.Dune: Part Two stands steady on its own, it felt complete compared to the more introductory feel of Part One. Despite this, I still felt like it lays groundwork for Dune: Part Three/Messiah, leaving a sense of setup. The movie, while feeling like a precursor, still manages to provide a more conclusive ending. I also think you should watch Part One first, if that has to be said; and the prospect of a back-to-back viewing sounds like a fun afternoon.One thing I can complain about is Stilger. I have mixed feelings. In Part One, Javier was fierce and was my favorite character, in this movie though he's depicted as a religious fanatic for the most part. It was done well, but I still miss the Stilgar who walked up to Duke Leto Atreides with no disregard. This felt like a different person, still fierce, just different.Loved Austin butler though, I wasn't sure what to expect as I tried my best to avoid trailers and teasers apart from the Dune part one bonus content. That short lady in charge of extracting 'the water of life' had some insane calves on her, I'm extremely jealous.While I was initially not convinced about Timothée Chalamet as the lead, he truly owns the role in the sequel, displayed acting facets I'd not seen before from him. The movie essentially unfolds as Paul Atreides' coming-of-age story, with Zendaya delivering an amazing performance. The first act, focusing on their love story, adds depth to the events at the movie's end. Zendaya's portrayal transcends the typical love story, I hope her role extends into Dune: Messiah, and hopefully adds further complexity to her character.We see Paul undergo some transformations. From being the son of royalty to experiencing love, the narrative takes a surprising turn when he assumes authority in the third act. Although I liked it, it felt a bit rushed. But, I found solace/logic with the ""water of life"" spiritual poison, where drinking it resulted in a profound shift in your personality. The contrast between the before and after versions of Paul, as well as Jessica, is striking so it kinda made sense to me.I think watching this movie at home won't do it justice, it's clearly made for the big screens if you can. It's pretty epic and I think it'll remain memorable as one of 2024's best movies, despite only being February. I absolutely loved it."," Not every movie is Schindler's list"

"80","Dune: Part Two","thePopcornExplorer","7/10","7 March 2024","I have to start by saying that I absolutely loved the first movie. I wasn't familiar with the story and I went with zero expectations, only to be completely stunned by the masterful artwork that was Dune Part 1.The music, the sound, the visuals, the entire world and its atmosphere, the characters even the plot, I found everything beautifully crafted and a breath of fresh air for the Sci-Fi genre.I am not familiar with the source material so this is considering only the movies and while I had a deep desire to love this second part specially considering the reviews it has been getting and how much I loved the first one, I couldn't help but feel a slight disappointment...
Let's start with the positives - the cinematography is consistently out of this world, it is a visual wonder, a mix of practical effects with CGI that blends in perfectly. The intense and dramatic sound effects associated with a thrilling and daunting soundtrack delivers! And of course the acting is consistently good, this time around it was great to see Javier Barden's character being developed and bringing some great topics to the table.What makes me wonder the most to be honest is how different both the first movie and the second are being reviewed by the general public..
For once its running time is considerable (almost 3 hours) and somehow it feels strangely rushed... It's a bit odd to explain but in other words, we get so many scenes that feel that don't contribute at all to the narrative and out of the blue we transition to a scene where the main character changes the demeanor entirely without much build up leading to it..
The movie spends so much time trying to connect Paul to the Fremens, yet it fails to explore his own inner motivations, the moment we see his character changing, it gives you the feeling that you missed something.Paul's betrayal to Chani also feels a bit irrelevant since the chemistry built on the first movie seems to just dissipate...
The relationship with his mother is also very odd and inconsistent, her character becomes dark fairly early in the movie, in one moment she is her beloved mother and without much shared screen time he then seems to almost despise her by the end of the film without the audience having a deeper understanding of their relationship dynamic.The newly introduced villains are one dimensional and having Austin Butler's character seemed pointless... there was no goal for him, he gets killed off almost instantly alongside with the Baron who got so much build from the first movie...
An A list of actors like Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken and Léa Seydoux, all of them could've been amazing characters but get zero chance of showing that.An entire plot with Paul's sister goes out the drain as well... messing with time started to become promising but it leads nowhere... I mean I could go on, in short the movie had many plot gaps, didn't develop the characters properly, poorly introduced the newcomers and relied heavily on its outstanding cinematography and sound.It's a shame because I can't tell you how excited I was to write a praising review, but this was my honest opinion which apparently doesn't seem to align with the majority.A lot of scenes drag without much substance to it, the highlight of the film was Javier Barden's character and the messages behind the dangerous of the concept of a Messia.I am of course hopeful for the third movie, maybe with my expectations now lowered it becomes a great experience all over again."," entertaining, cheesy eighties fun"
"81","Dune: Part Two","Dvir971","10/10","26 February 2024","Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended."," Not disappointed!"

Personally, I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well. So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer.For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress.

"83","Dune: Part Two","poseyfan","10/10","1 March 2024","""Dune"" has been successfully put to the big screen. Not only is this a good adaptation, it passes with flying colors.The character arc of Paul Atreides is fascinating and complex. I love how they delved into his psyche and motivations so prevalently in this movie. He is reluctant to take up the Messianic mantle because he knows it's a lie. But things go according to his vision and he becomes a morally complex character. Religious fantacism takes hold of the fremen.It is up for interpretation what kind of character Paul becomes. Is he a tyrant? Was it the only path? What does religion have to do with it? Paul takes hold of the Bene Gesserit lie by exploiting faith.This leads to other questions. Can one truly trust the arm of flesh? The frailty of man? Leaders have come and gone throughout history bringing different ideals.One's own morality comes into play. Agency is vital to the human experience. Man will always falter. This leads to questions of a higher power and His role. Is there a God above? What are the implications of that?We don't get stories like this in Hollywood anymore. There is no happy ending in Dune, and one can only ponder the moral complexities of it. The book and movie have made me contemplate many things and I deeply appreciate stories like that.Others have already applauded the effects, acting and script, so I won't go into that too much here. What I will say is it was the best looking movie I have ever seen. Everything looked lived in. The fight scenes were choreographed masterfully. Each actor gave outstanding performances.

"87","Dune: Part Two","Sleepin_Dragon","10/10","29 February 2024","Paul has to prove himself to both Chani and The Fremen, his dreams become more vivid, one path leads to destruction, maybe even the loss of Chani.I don't think I've anticipated a film quite so much as this, since being spellbound by the first, I counted down the days for this follow up, and by chance got to see it a day early.In one single word, captivating, the best film I've seen in a very long time, absolutely wonderful from start to finish, the character development, visuals, music, action sequences are all tremendous.We get to see Paul growing before our very eyes, the character at the end of the film is very different to the one at the start, the best yet from Chalamet, he shows a degree of grit.A special mention about the performance of Austin Butler, I thought he was incredibly good as Feyd Rauth, what a menacing villain, one of those that had you wondering about what he'd do next, and that makeup, awesome.I can't fault a single performance, inspired casting, backed up by a marvellous script.The music is spot on once again, I instantly wanted to download Ripples in The sand and Paul's Dream once again.Incredible visuals, from the amazing location work, to the creative camera work, and the jaw dropping special effects.I thought this was going to be the toughest movie of the franchise, as so much happens at the start and the finish, it wasn't the case, this was a fabulous movie.10/10."," Solid cheese"
"88","Dune: Part Two","geotech-27507","8/10","2 March 2024","As with the first film, the production was beautiful. I loved the opening scenes with the Harkonnen soldiers. The arena fight between Austin Butler and the last Atreides Robert Yuan (actors names) was fantastic. The battles with the harvesters were phenomenal.The script, however, left me a little bit disappointed. What about the Guild Navigators? And how were the worms used after they came through the pass in the mountains opened up by the atomics? There was only one sequence of the initial charge (marvelous sequence when the gunships entered) but then nothing. The Sardurkar were not given enough respect in this film. There was only one scene that showed them respect and that was when they rose up from the fallen sand and rock debris and stood their ground preparing for the oncoming onslaught instead of panicking. Other than that I felt the film should have spent more time on tactical combat scenes in what was supposed to be an epic battle at the end of the film, maybe trim time off of the other dragged out sequences in the film. The first movie did a better job with the Sardaukar, you actually feared them. The epic battle at the end of this movie was less than epic. And poor Bautista, they should not have made him act like such a wimp, should have had a more glorious fight even in retreat.As much as I like Walken, I thought he was poorly cast to be Emperor. The 1984 film had a perfect actor for the personality. This is Villeneuve's fault, he picked him.The script also fails to emphasize that Paul is the Kwisatz Haderach at the end of the movie. Paul's initial ability to vaguely see the future comes from the centuries of genetic tinkering of the women of the Ben Gesserat, but after he drinks the water of life and not only survives but develops the ability to see an individual's past, as evident by the scenes in the Fremen temple where he looks at individuals and describes their past, and more clearly sees optional future outcomes, and after he actually fulfills all of the prophecies of the Fremen, the story is true, he really is the Messiah of Arrakis, justifying the religion, and he really is the Kwisatz Haderach, a man with abilities that no other man has. But the film appears to gloss over this. Shame. He is not just some populist charismatic man blamed by the likes of Zendaya's character for (perceived) fooling anyone to follow him and falling for the appeal of power and giving up his principles, he is more than that.My critique of the first film was not enough emotion, well part 2 does a better job, especially after Paul survives the water of life and becomes the anti-hero, all hell breaks loose. And Zendaya's character being a more independent women than the 1984 film was interesting, albeit the combat skills or luck were not realistic unless you buy that the Sardaukar were that inept. Part 1 was a better drama than part 2, but part 2 has some great action sequences, besides the disappointments I mentioned earlier. Not a perfect film for this Dune 1984 admirer."," An entertaining joy ride"

Dune 2, I would see it again tomorrow. The story is on par to the Star Wars legacy, the acting, on par with Oppenheimer, the SFX better than the two movies just mentioned combined. When the movie finished (over 2 and half hours) I still wanted more. The emotional ride was like nothing I can remember from ANY movie I can remember. Best movie of the year?

The characters, acting, screenplay, world building, storytelling, score, actions sequences, cinematography, and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking. The casting continuation was perfect all the way through, with great new add-ons. Timothee Chalamet is believable, raw and real as Paul Atriedes. He was flawless as the lead. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts.Overall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale.

I've loved this director's work since ""Blade Runner 2049"", and ""Arrival"". He did an excellent job placing his vision on the first Dune, but here, Villeneuve cranks his direction times 10!The structure, set-up, visuals, sound and story are crafted in ways that are hard for me to put in words, due to how everything came together so miraculously. The acting is also top-notch! Timothée Chalamet in particular is unbelievably phenomenal, and Zendaya does a great job as well. Austin Butler, Rebecca Ferguson and Florence Pugh are also excellent! Denis never lets you out of this experience! The pure weight of the film is presented through astounding narratives, rich cinematography, an epic story and mesmerizing action sequences that will make your seat rumble if you watch this on the big screen!There are quite a handful of thrilling moments that I still have no idea how they came out THIS good in the end! Denis Villeneuve is truly a sorcerer in the Sci-Fi genre! Every frame and detail in his films are captivating as hell, and it's no different here in the slightest!Dune: Part Two made me leave the theater feeling inspired!

"93","Dune: Part Two","davidmvining","7/10","1 March 2024","Denis Villeneuve's second half of his adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune fully embraces the spectacle inherent in the material while also digging into the core implications that Herbert was exploring around power, cults of personality, and leadership. He flips some things around (I'm pretty sure), but otherwise delivers a handsome, exciting, second half to what he had started. And then he highlights Chani way too much, changing her character so much that she sticks out like a sore thumb to curious purposes that do little more than distract from what's going on around her. Seriously, if the final twenty seconds of this film were chopped off and lost in a fire, I'd actually be a good bit more positive on the film.Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother the Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have joined the Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Barden). Paul grows close to Chani (Zendaya) who helps teach him the ways of the desert as they go into hiding from the dominant Harkonnen led by the Baron (Stellan Skarsgard), his elder nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista) left as governor of the desert planet Arrakis while the Baron continues to groom his younger nephew Feyd (Austin Butler) towards leadership. Operating as an exposition dump for those who didn't remember the first film is Irulan (Florence Pugh), nominally taking up her chronicling duties from the book (her entries marking the start of every chapter), while her father, the Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), quietly ruminates on the implications of his plan to eradicate the Atreides perhaps failing.This is one of those stories that I know so well, that I kind of assume that everyone knows. And yet, Dune, for all it's popularity among scifi nerds, isn't the grand cultural touchpoint it's sometimes made out to be. Its influences are strong and wide, but the actual story knowledge isn't.Anyway, now's the time to talk about some creative choices. The first that screams out to me is how much more stylized visually the film is. The film opens with a scene of Harkonnen troops attacking the Fremen in the desert, and Villeneuve uses a partial eclipse as an excuse to bathe the entire scene in a deep orange. It's really nice to look at. I've been curious about the black and white segments in the trailers since I've seen them, and the explanation is that Geidi Prime has a black sun making it so that outside just looks like that. Knowing more from the books, I'd say that the whole Harkonnen look is something I'd attribute more to the Bene Tlielax, but it's at least interesting to see.There's a heavy emphasis on the Bene Gesserit and their breeding program in here, which I appreciate. I think that most heavily gets highlighted in the inclusion of Lady Margot Fenring (Lea Seydoux), a Bene Gesserit sent to Geidi Prime to seduce Feyd, secure his bloodline, and learn how to manipulate him should certain probabilities arise. She is very briefly seen in a modified form in the Sci-Fi Channel series, but otherwise she's never made an appearance in an adaptation. Although, unless Villeneuve is planning on using material from the sequel novels written by Brian Herbert (please no), Lady Fenring shouldn't be making any more appearances, making this feel like something of a dead end that still manages to provide some nice detail in terms of worldbuilding.And that leads me to the editing. I like how much detail gets brought in to help fill out the world (universe) of Dune, but there are some places where the film feels too fast. Take, for instance, the jump from Paul and Chani sitting on a dune watching a wormrider in the distance, Chani explaining to Paul that he'll never become a rider because he's not really Fremen. Cut ahead to about fifteen minutes later in screentime, there's been no mention of Paul training or anything, and now it's time for Paul to ride his first worm. Time has obviously passed, and this feels like the instance of a cut scene that was deemed unnecessary. However, considering how much time gets dedicated to Fenring's seduction of Feyd, it makes you wonder if the priorities were in total alignment when cutting the film down to its current length.So, Paul stays in the northern parts of Arrakis to lead the small revolt of the Fedaykin fighters against the Harkonnen while Jessica, pregnant and having become the Fremen's Reverend Mother through the changing of the Water of Life from poison into a harmless drink (no orgy in this mostly sexless adaptation), a process that awakens her unborn daughter, Alia, into consciousness. Gonna be honest, Jessica talking to Alia outloud is great. It's just the right kind of funny in this universe. Anyway, Jessica becomes a fanatic in the pursuit of Paul's legend as the Mahdi, the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World, while Paul resists it. If I remember correctly, this is something of a complete reversal where Paul easily fell into the legend to help him fight while Jessica saw it as something of a survival mechanism, an unfortunate path she had to take to stay alive. I don't mind this change because Furgeson as a madwoman is great to watch.Things escalate. The Emperor must come to Arrakis. There is a showdown, and that showdown is great. It reminded me of the epic ending to James Cameron's Avatar, a movie I have no great love for but which, I cannot deny, has a freaking awesome final act action sequence. Atomics, worms, giant spaceships, it all comes together in an action and special effects extravaganza that Villeneuve manages with aplomb. It's great fun.Now, Chani. Chani is given extra prominence, and I really don't like how they did it. She is one of the Fremen who does not believe in the Lisan al-Gaib, and she sticks to that belief through everything she witnesses. As Paul is presenting all of the signs, as Chani herself is becoming part of the prophecy that she rejects through literal actions, she not only resists, but she fights back against it. It's so out of place, and it goes through to the end of the film. Sure, Herbert having Chani blithely accept that the love of her life is going to marry an imperial princess for power was always a bit thin, but turning the ending of the film into watching her pouting is just wrong.The story of Dune is Paul going from boy to man to leader to godhead. It's not Chani being mad that Paul is going from boy to man to leader to godhead. Ending on her was a mistake.Anyway, it's a spectacle. I think it gets the heart of Herbert's message right. It mixes things up to some degree and to not entirely successful effect. As an adaptation of Dune, I think the Sci-Fi miniseries is probably the best, but as a filmed experience, this is the more exciting and complete of the three attempts."," As good as it gets"

Everything from part one was done even better in part two and the story was much more interesting. The outfits were so unique and really well made. Whenever I thought it was starting to move a little slow something insane happens and I'm instantly drawn back into the world of dune that Denis has remade and expanded on so much. All the shots of the different worlds were just breathtaking. The last hour of the movie is by far some of the best made cinema in awhile and the action was so good.

"95","Dune: Part Two","Jason24321","10/10","2 March 2024","Frank Herbert's Dune is widely considered to be some of the most challenging science fiction material to adapt to the big screen. In 2021, Villeneuve hit it out of the park with Dune - Part One. In Part Two, he outdoes himself in every way. From cinematography to music to choreography to acting and dialogue, this movie had a mountain to climb to prove itself, and it did.With Hans Zimmer composing the score, it should surprise no one how well it compliments the film. Greig Fraser (Dune - Part One, The Creator, The Batman) was at the helm of cinematography, and really took my breath away with the magnificent vistas, incredible use of colours and even infrared, and expert capture of motion and scale. Fraser explains that they shot in digital, transposed to 35mm, then back to digital. This seemed absurd to me, until he explained that digital appeared too crisp for audiences, and film too nostalgic. His method obtained the perfect balance. I can't fault him for that, because I agree.The real risk here is of course the adaptation. How to retain some of the richest and most beloved science fiction lore in existence and condense it into the 2 hours and 46 minutes runtime. Villeneuve took a huge risk by splitting the first book into two parts. Had studios not green-lit part two, we would have been left with half a book. Unsatisfying for everyone. Thankfully the gamble paid off, and he was able to tell the epic story across two movies bordering on three hours. Even this required a brisk pace, with many notable scenes omitted. Despite this, I think Villeneuve retained the heart and soul of the story. He created two movies which appeal to both general audiences, and fans alike. There is so much to love here that I can't imagine anyone walking away feeling unsatisfied with the price of entry.See this on the biggest screen you can find. Then see it again. The visuals and score demand it. You will not be disappointed."," Yes, an 8"
"96","Dune: Part Two","movies_are_life_","6/10","5 March 2024","I want to love this movie. Despite being in a confused state throughout the film, I enjoyed what I was seeing visually. The lack of dialogue didn't work for me, although it's an aspect that would lessen the more I learned about the characters and world. I just don't get much of a chance at that within the movie. Despite my uninvolvement of the Dune world and its characters, I still have to be honest with the faults of the script and editing.Other than the overarching plot, scenes happen rather than you being lead into scenes via an emotional journey. The first hour is a back and forth of random tests and does she like him or not. Many characters simply appear in the movie, some deep into the runtime, including a main villain who has no discernible traits other than evil for the sake of it. Some characters appear very briefly and don't do much at all. The motivation of everyone was stripped out of the script. We see an abundant amount of screen time on someone riding a worm, but large battles will abrubtly end after very little setup. Did we need a large segment of screen time involving the nukes, when we could've just been told that there's nukes? The nuke scene feels as a standout filler sequence perhaps to be overshadow a few dozen moments of filler that could've been replaced with plot.I would challenge the praisers of this film to explain why everything was perfect. Austin Butler's character was great! Why? Because he was so one dimensional? The battles are the best! You mean snippets of battles that we got and one where it was hard to tell who was who. The score was amazing! Oh, the unbelievably overused bong noise that will randomly appear in the most tepid of scenes? Even the ""twist"" ending was foreshadowed in the first few minutes. This film is all spectacle with no emotional payoff. The number one praise that people will use to describe greatness of Dune 2 is the cinematography. This should be a leg that a great movie stands on, not the foundation. Although the direction and technicality of the look of Dune 2 is epic, the writing and editing are faulty. Maybe upon rewatches I would like it more since I might understand more of the details (after getting those details from other sources), but it's still nowhere as good as it could be or as most everyone seems to think it is."," It's good"
"97","Dune: Part Two","Sakaresm","7/10","2 March 2024","I mean, yeah, it's very entertaining and, of course, very visually stunning. The set pieces, the cinematography, the use of visual effects and lights, the sound design and music, all, absolutely amazing and almost literally stunning!But then? I'm not really seeing much after that. As I have not read the books, this movie was a total mystery to me. There's barely any dialog--at least not any that would explain anything what's going on at all. The world and the technology etc just doesn't make much sense to me.None of the characters are particularly interesting, to be honest. They don't really have that much personality to them, and even if they did, they didn't really make me care about them all that much.I don't know, I'm a bit conflicted, it wasn't a bad movie and, as I said, it was entertaining and visually mesmerizing, but it lacked the depth that I was expecting of a world this size and this rich with lore and history. Maybe the movie makers assumed everyone has read the books? As someone to who the world is not familiar at all, it just seems rather confusing and strange. I feel like they just focused on making it as visually awesome as they can (in which they arguably succeeded), but left the story on the pages of the books."," A movie worth watching"

"99","Dune: Part Two","zkonedog","7/10","1 March 2024","Dune 2 is a big screen action/adventure spectacle the likes of which hasn't been seen since, well, maybe the first Dune in 2021. But when it comes to paying off what the original effort set up so perfectly, this sophomore sequel doesn't quite hit it out of the park.For a very basic overview, Dune 2 picks up with Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) living amongst the Fremen after House Atreides being all but wiped out in the House Harkonnen collaboration with the Emperor's army to re-take Arrakis. Though Jessica and Stilgar (Javier Bardem) continue to tout Paul as the mythical prophesized messiah per the Bene Gesserit religious sect, Paul isn't yet convinced-nor are other Fremen like Chani (Zendaya). Will Paul accept the mantle and risk all-out religious war-or choose to remain embedded ""locally"" with the Fremen? Meanwhile, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) is struggling to control spice production on Arrakis, so unhinged nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) is called in for assistance. Finally, the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) scheme to keep themselves in power over all of the machinations.There is absolutely no doubt that Dune 2 is cinema spectacle of the highest order. Director Denis Villeneuve composes a film that should be seen in the biggest format possible (to truly appreciate the scale) and within the best sound structure (Dolby Atmos for me and it was theater-rumbling!). There is never a dull moment from beginning to end-always something interesting to look at or immerse yourself in on screen.Here's the issue with Dune 2: the first film was one of the best world-building setups I've ever seen in a flick. It expertly dropped viewers into the planetary conflict, gradually built up the key characters, and imbued it all with a sense of great mystery and intrigue. While this sequel technically pays off all those setups, it doesn't always do so in the most satisfying or understandable of ways. I won't go into every nook and cranny here, but a few examples:-Paul resists his messianic calling the entire film-until the end when he just ""gives in""?-The fetus within Jessica is talking to her and will someday grow up to be Anya Taylor-Joy's brief cameo character?-Even after Paul accepts his mantle-the Houses won't acknowledge him?-The bombshell of Paul's more-diverse-than-we-realized bloodline came off as anticlimactic, especially considering how it immediately becomes the driving force of the film's endgame.I know that there is an answer to every question posed above-but none of it felt all that satisfactory or revelatory to me. Part of the problem could be that I was expecting more of a definitive ending and received a ""setting up a franchise"" denouement instead. A particularly telling observation was how my favorite character in the entire movie was Butler's Feyd-Rautha. Why? Because-like in Dune 1-it was something completely different/new and shrouded in mystery that Villeneuve was able to unwind.So, in my final reckoning of Dune 2, the visual spectacle and star-studded cast do most of the heavy-lifting. If you don't see this one from a theater seat at least once, you are doing yourself a disservice. But if you are looking for a plot-tight, perfectly character-fulfilling narrative, you may walk away a little disappointed (at least compared to the first Villeneuve Dune)."," Why's the hating"

I only saw Christopher Walken as Christopher Walken.And I might be the only person on Earth who finds Florence Pugh to be the epitome and definition of BLAND. They could have hired someone they found walking at a random mall to play Irulan.Also the movie feels like an episode more than the conclusion of a two-part movie. I can only assume that is to set up a continuation of the Dune novels. So if the pacing and climax and ending all feel wonky to you, that is the best explanation I can give to you in your time of cinematic need.Otherwise, the film is entertaining for its length.
