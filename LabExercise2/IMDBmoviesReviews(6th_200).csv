"1","Anyone But You","irmahakanssonkontakt","10/10","20 February 2024","It's cheesy, hilarous, spicy and the lead guy is smoking hot - it's perfect! It's just like a rom-com should be. It's also a breath of fresh air because, even though it contained many of the major rom-com tropes, many new, unexpected and fun things happened - especially regarding the settings, the specifik plot and the side-characters. Beau especially was absolutely hilarious. The movie also immediately catches your attention with the first scene. If you didn't like this movie, rom-come might not be for you because this is the best rom-com I have seen in a while. I also love ""Unwritten"" by Natasha Bedingfieldüòç"," The perfect rom-com!"
"2","Anyone But You","Maggysbird","6/10","10 February 2024","The six points are for Glenn Powell as I couldn't see anything appealing about the female lead. I found her quite wooden and bland. I'm thinking Kate Hudson type vibes. I don't think I've seen her in anything else so I have no comparison to her other work. I have watched a few of Powell's other movies and really enjoyed his performances. I also felt they were mismatched on an attractiveness scale, her being the one who was seriously punching. The story was pretty corny and incredibly predictable but it's not an unpleasant film, just a bit daft. I certainly wouldn't watch it again even if I was bored. Each to their own I suppose but it wasn't for me."," A bit meh"
"3","Anyone But You","BogiRay","8/10","20 February 2024","The main story is good but the side characters are very meaningless. The movie starts very quickly and the story does not deepen.

"4","Anyone But You","madkatwhiskers","2/10","7 March 2024","It's broken. It's gone and never coming back, even if it's based on Shakespeare.We will never again have unapologetically witty and funny romcoms with crazy hot tension between the main characters. (How to lose a guy in 10 days, Ugly Truth, What happens in Vegas, 10 things I hate about you, Pretty Woman, Hitch)No one wants to stay through an hour and a half of therapy talk, and characters telling us not liking the cringe makes us cringe. Sweeney does that.The script is dry and devoid of any real humor. Boomers apologizing for non-issues is not that funny, especially when worked into the few scenes recreating some of the finest dialogue in Much Ado About Nothing.The main characters constantly undercut themselves with petty reactions to misunderstandings. Powell's and Sweeney's characters lack depth, and it's not because of their delivery. They were directed to reflect on and criticize their characters without providing adequate context or background.We do not understand why Ben (Powell) is a fboy. Has he magically inherited his Hangman karma from Top Gun? Are we to infer that from his Patrick Bateman workout regiment? Was he that disappointed they did not have sex on the first date? Is he actually keen on his ex?Nor are we told why Bea (Sweeney) is conflicted about law school or understand why she broke up with her fiance. She always wanted to get married and possibly have a family. We are told as much.She says she didn't like they never fought with her fiance. But it's not the fighting she enjoys with Ben, and it's evident because they suck at it. They actually had a very pleasant first encounter characterized by the absence of any confrontation.If I am reading too much about rom-com characters, it is because these two seem fixed to question their thoughts and actions throughout the movie continuously. I cannot fathom how Gluck, who gave us a gem twenty years ago with Easy A and Emma Stone's memorable monologues, is responsible for this.There were a couple of moments when the movie tried to redeem itself.Powell decided the best way for Sweeney to inspect him for any crawling critters was by spreading his cheeks. Interestingly, this is the only part of the millennial vulgar wave humor they kept- perhaps to make amends for the overall lack of funny.The mother-in-law eventually puts an end to all non-adult behavior. ""No one is 29""- get it together.Not enough to stay through the whole thing."," Rom-com knowhow is lost"
"5","Anyone But You","lucymdancer","10/10","5 January 2024","This movie was a cinematic masterpiece, it was so funny and really balanced the immature feuding with mature themes. The character have complex backgrounds while all contributing again and again to the drama which always makes everything more entertaining. The chemistry that the actors have is amazing and their stories are so funny and realistic. The main characters were again and again going through cycles of love to hate to civil and starting all over again. The story line has so many amazing jokes and themes that no other movie I've seen before has executed. Love this movie so much, definitely recommend."," Hilarious"
"6","Anyone But You","mzndpqy","9/10","24 January 2024","I wanted to watch the movie again the next day to immerse myself in the beautiful feel-good movie world of ""Anything but you"" and escape the dreary January.Watch the trailer and you'll know what to expect. The movie is perfect when the mood is gloomy, the weather is bad or you just want something nice. Why?Reason number 1: The beautiful scenery. The movie takes place in Australia on beautiful beaches and an even more beautiful beach house.Reason number 2: The movie has really funny moments and not too many over-the-top cringe moments like other comedies.Reason number 3: The lead actors Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell in particular have a certain chemistry that makes it fun to watch.And reason number 4: The movie always sets ""cool"" scenes through well-chosen songs. The epitome of this is the creative use of ""Unwritten"".The typical romcom ending could perhaps have been implemented a little smarter, but the movie delivers no less than you would expect from a good romcom, in fact a little more."," Like your feelgood sitcom for Sunday evenings, only as a movie"

This is one of those movies that you don't need to use any braincells to watch - and the less you have, the better. Do yourself a favor and save some time.I really hope no one in real life acts like the cast in this movie. The best actor in the cast is the dog. I'm sure Australians also didn't enjoy watching the stereotyped lines from the Australians in the movie.Good things about this movie:

"9","Anyone But You","griffin-62013","10/10","23 January 2024","""Anyone but You"" effortlessly captures the essence of love and laughter, earning a well-deserved 10/10. Sydney Sweeney's portrayal in the film is nothing short of exceptional, bringing a refreshing authenticity to the characters.The movie's strength lies in its clever use of rude humor, which adds a distinctive flavor to the narrative. The sharp wit and comedic timing contribute to the overall enjoyment, creating a lighthearted atmosphere that keeps the audience engaged.What truly sets this romantic comedy apart is its ability to forge a genuine connection with the audience through the portrayal of relationships. The characters are relatable, and the chemistry between them is palpable. Viewers find themselves easily immersed in the unfolding story, making the emotional beats resonate on a personal level.The film's success can be attributed to a well-crafted balance of humor and heartfelt moments. The script, combined with the stellar performances, weaves a narrative that not only entertains but also tugs at the heartstrings. Sydney Sweeney's acting prowess shines through, adding layers of depth to the characters and making them memorable.In essence, ""Anyone but You"" is a cinematic gem that delivers on multiple fronts. It's a testament to the power of a well-executed romantic comedy, leaving audiences with a warm and satisfied feeling proving that rom-coms can actually have success in the box office. Whether you're a fan of witty humor, compelling characters, or just a good love story, this film ticks all the boxes and deserves its perfect score."," The revitalization of Romantic Comedy in theaters"
"10","Anyone But You","miminganongobosso","4/10","28 March 2024","I watched this movie in theater with my friend. We watched it because the song Unwritten is very hyped on TikTok. But you need to know that I live in Germany and in Germany we have a thing called FSK (Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft) That means that the maker of the movie can decide what the minimum age is to watch it. And I have no idea who decided the FSK for this movie but in Germany the FSK is 0. That means that little children from 0 years can watch it. The problem is that in this film the actors sometimes are not wearing much clothes. The movie is way too much sexual for little children. Because in the theater we were sitting in there were also kids that were like 7-10 years old. And this movie is definitely not made for this age range."," Little children"
"11","Anyone But You","Szekerlacey","10/10","21 February 2024","The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable! The first is a little awkward but still gets some laugh, classic misunderstanding, but there has to be for there to be a movie. Powell has talents in both drama and comedy, Sweeney seems new on the scene, but she's got the quirky gorgeous girl next door down perfect! They are both super attractive, but I gotta say, I was laughing so hard through scenes, I had to remember I was in a movie theater even though the people next to me were laughing their butts off too. I can't wait to see it again and that includes the predictable but cute ending. Best rom com in a long time!"," Hot, cute and hilariously funny!"
"12","Anyone But You","tlmoulds","7/10","29 December 2023","Anyone but you is exactly what it needs to be and tries to be, a simple rom-com where you watch two attractive people trade banter, face complications, and eventually fall in love.I think some people go into these moves wanting more from the story or characters. If that's the case go watch Hunger Games or something...Glenn & Sydney played their parts perfectly.There chemistry and banter left me in tears at points, with some memorable scenes and WTF moments that made me laugh. Honestly, I can see why their on screen banter turned into off screen love.I think all the side characters were played well. No one stood out but were all required to get to the end objective and provided some funny scene along the way. The pool diving scene was a particular WTF moment that made me giggle, However, they continually made reference to it throughout the movie which made it more funny as the movie progressed.All in all, Good Friday night movie and is the clear definition of a good early 2000's rom-com and ticks all the boxes;

This was one of the best romcom movies I've seen since This Means War. I thought the character development was a little bit rushed , but the chemistry between the two main actors was on point the whole movie. I didn't want to get out of my seat, and enjoyed all the added humor, twists and turns, and the way the predictable (but good) ending occurred. I really enjoyed this movie and encourage anyone to give it a chance. There was definitely more funny scenes in the main plot than the trailer showed too."," Blew expectations out of water"
"14","Anyone But You","mirandajdoyle","10/10","12 January 2024","I have read many reviews referring to this film as ""bad Shakespeare fan fiction"".However, it is exactly what it intended to be, there is no deep intertextuality or appropriation. The film is simply a fun rom com loosely based on Much Ado About Nothing.Having studied the play, I found the film a fun and fresh take on the original plot and themes presented by Shakespeare. Along with the obvious references, the more subtle ones were clever and conceiving.The film was sharp, clever and included character development that I haven't seen in a contemporary romantic comedy since the early 2000's. The chapter adaptations were comedic and clever and well suited to a modern day setting and the inclusion of animal magic was well played. The charismatic leads and chemistry between Sweeney and Powell also made it both powerful and enjoyable.Anyone but you is perfect for what it intended to be- a modern twist on classic literature with some laughs, tears and loveable characters all with an interesting personal storyline."," Shakespeare ""fun"" fiction"
"15","Anyone But You","Shanegames07","7/10","1 January 2024","The first movie review of 2024, I watched another Rom Com on Saturday called Anyone but you but I never had time to write an review until today.This movie starts off with the two main stars meeting in a coffee place which all romantic movies start at, he buys her a tea and then gets her the Toilet key which then sparks an interest in her eyes. But after they spend the night together something goes wrong when Bee overhears Ben saying she's not good enough.After they fall out about what Ben said they get invited on a wedding of Bee sister wedding who happens to be getting married to his woman's best friend.The comedy was actually pretty good throughout the movie i remember during the movie the entire cinema was laughing for the comedy.There's something about this movie but I think this is the first Rom Com that actually has the chemistry between the two main stars Glenn Powell and Sydney Sweeney. Those two are both pretty attractive too which surely anyone can admit.I remember when I was serving a couple at my work they asked have I seen it and I said no no yet but I've heard some things they asked what things. I replied with all I've been told is Sydney Sweeney is pretty much in a bikini the whole movie.Another solid rom com to watch I would highly recommend watching this movie I think this is up there with the rest of the rom coms that I actually enjoyed.I hope these Rom Coms that are getting made keep being good because I think that's 2 Rom Coms in 2 that came out in the cinemas which was pretty good the Jennifer Lawernce one and Anyone but you.I would give this a 7 out of 10."," Anyone But You"

However, walking out the cinema I was pleasantly surprised.It's an enjoyable, funny and quirky lovers to haters to lovers again sort of film. Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are brilliant together and even though some of the supporting characters don't add a lot, they still come away with one or two funny lines to keep the smile on your face.The comedy for the most part is funny although there were some moments that made me cringe more than laugh but hey it's a rom-com what should I expect?All in all it added to an enjoyable evening and can definitely see my girlfriend bringing it back up next time she tries to convince me to go see another rom-com."," Enjoyable comedy with the classic rom-com cringe"

Besides Glen Powell, Sydney Sweeney and Bryan Brown, the rest of the supporting cast as wooden and have the acting ability and warmth of cardboard cutouts.The story is based around a lesbian wedding (tick) with one of the women being from a mixed race family (tick).Don't get me wrong, I love the chemistry and banter between Sweeney and Powell but that's as far as it goes.

I very much enjoy romcoms, normally 2 hours of enjoyment, no hassle, brain easing activity. This one was very flat. First, Ben is heartborken because Bea leaves him without saying anything. Later in the movie he does the same to her. Where is the logic in there? It was just not well thought out or interesting at all. The end when Ben decided to go after Bea, he jumped into the sea. Shouldn't have been easier to drive to the Opera House or catch a taxi just like Bea did? No, jump into the water, wait for emergency response and ask them to do you a favor and fly you where you want to go...

I just don't understand how a group of people made this in the first place. I don't know whose fault it is, the writer, the director, the cinematographer, the actors or anyone involved in this movie, but this movie was absolutely flawed from beginning till the end.Guy meets a girl who knows about toilet rules in the states proving her ignorance. More characters comes in showcasing their idiocracy. The movie's title should have been idiocracy. I'd have liked the movie then. It would give the movie a meaning it so much needed.The last scene was outrageous. I had to bite a comb to hold my anger. The girl leaves in a cab, nobody knew where she went , but the guy immediately figured out where she went.

"20","Anyone But You","ptbarnett","4/10","1 April 2024","""Anyone But You"" does not even have the potential to be a Hallmark romance.Dermot Mulroney and Brian Brown were worthy additions, but not enough to cover a huge casting flaw and poor script.Powell delivered a solid role but lowered his standards for a beyond-cheesy story.There is no chemistry between Powell and Sweeney, perhaps due to her voice. Sweeney is very pretty...until she opens her mouth. It seems to be a trend among younger actresses to growl, squeak, an d not enunciate. Annoying to the point of switching off the movie.

"23","Anyone But You","diforst","6/10","4 February 2024","However....other than Glen Powell, the cast of Anyone But You was less than mediocre at acting even though there are many serviceable journeymen actors in the movie. This film has a cute premise and the travelogue of Sydney is more than spectacular. The outline of the story is a good start, but the dialogue is below juvenile. There were more F bombs than in an action movie. In my humble opinion, the more four letter words in a script, the less likely the screenwriter is of their abilities. If you bother to watch 1930 comedies, the plot and dialogue are usually good enough that it's not necessary to shock the viewers.

"26","Anyone But You","barbett-1","5/10","1 January 2024","Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."," Average rom-com fare"
"27","Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","4/10","5 January 2024","I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."," F-grade rom-com with little rom and even less com"
"28","Anyone But You","dogonlion","1/10","10 February 2024","Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made. I guess as long as those kinds of movies make money they'll keep the same formula and keep factory produce them and soon will use artificial intelligence to write them."," Any movie but this"
"29","Anyone But You","ambusched94","2/10","31 December 2023","A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."," Forgettable rom-com that fails to spark and lacks believable romantic chemistry, hindered by bland acting from Sydney Sweeney and rushed, empty character development"
"30","Anyone But You","trinaboice","4/10","8 January 2024","IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs

I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie.

Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker.

Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny.Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like the studio shelled out something to tick boxes rather than make a well thought-out comedy (this included plot concepts, wardrobing, and jokes) because that's what they think the audience 'wants' as they try too hard to be 'modern,' meaning the director couldn't make any creative decisions; the direction on both a macro and microscale feels very formulaic to other Rom-Coms; the direction of actors is very bad as he does not establish any chemistry for the cast as all the performances feel mundane and toneless; the storytelling is a formulaic and predictable Rom-Com), Bad Acting (Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (The overall performance feels mundane and toneless and she fails to establish any chemistry with Glen Powell, but she does have some moments where she does a decent to pretty good job), Decent to Pretty Good from Glen Powell (The only positive performance in the movie as he holds his own and leads the movie well as a Rom-Com lead (it's just the material is so bad he can only do so much)), Decent from Alexandra Shipp (Actually holds her own well and shows some a little range (which is a lot given this movie)), Bad from GaTa (Cannot match the levels of any of the other actors and feels very toneless with little effort), Pretty Bad from Hadley Robinson (Just doesn't offer anything), Decent from Michelle Hurd (Shows some experience and decent timing), Decent from Dermot Mulroney (Has some charisma and timing), Decent from Charlee Fraser (The most surprising performance of the movie as she holds her own fairly well and establishes some charm and chemistry with Glen Powell), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of toneless and stereotypical Rom-Com performances; there is no chemistry in the entire cast)), Very Bad Story (The concept is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing,' but it does not do anything to be unique as it just follows the cookie cutter Rom-Com plot (mixed with forced modern references); the story construction is incredibly formulaic as each scene is incredibly predictable on what is going to happen and where it is going to go; because the movie is so predictable, there is a flow because it just follows this boilerplate to a tea; the character writing is terrible as all the characters as so shallow and stereotypical to Rom-Coms (and things are brought up for characters that never get addressed or add more depth to the characters)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious and very predictable (the movie forces in so many modern references that it just feels like they are pandering to the youth rather than writing realistic dialogue); the joke hit rate is probably 1 out of every 5 jokes (and some of the jokes are just so stupid that its cringe at how they even made this movie); the symbolism is incredibly overt (with the quotes from the source material and the messages of the story being overlaid onto the screen); the foreshadowing is incredibly overt that it makes the movie incredibly predictable), Decent Score; Decent Soundtrack (Did enjoy the songs they chose), Pretty Good Cinematography (Very polished as you could tell the studio put in a lot of money to make this movie), Pretty Bad Sound (Some of the sound effects are just off from what happened), Decent Editing (The actual edit was very polished and felt like it had a big budget; the cut for the movie just feels weird as it is obvious where they did reshoots and what was originally shot), Good Costumes (They made a very conscious decision with what each character was wearing to get people to watch this movie (and I respect that)), Plot Structure followed the source material's and Rom-Com template to a tee (which made the movie incredibly formulaic and predictable), Pacing was decent (as it kept the Rom-Com pace), Climax was so forced and incredibly formulaic (which made me cringe very hard when watching this movie), Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms (especially from the early 2010s), It was so obvious where there were reshoots for this movie as some of the scenes were so bad and some were more tolerable."," Bad Movie"
"34","Anyone But You","johnnymonsarrat","4/10","3 February 2024","Hello again, fellow film travelers.I have to wonder what happened to the writing of this movie. There are some interesting and touching twists to the plot. But mainly it seems plot driven, not character driven. Characters don't make consistent choices with their personality or logic, for example what happens with the parents at the end.The male lead has an acting style that's full of confidence, but he's supposed to be a comic figure that has disabling phobias. God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius. There was some good physical comedy and a few touchimg moments. But the cringe worthy flaws buried them."," Not goofy enough to be so plot driven, not character driven"
"35","Anyone But You","masonsaul","7/10","30 December 2023","Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected). A good soundtrack always helps with this genre and the one here nails it."," Nice to have a rom com at the cinema again"
"36","Anyone But You","Remmuchan","3/10","27 December 2023","I cannot for the life of me understand how this ended up being a movie shown in theaters. I went into this having no idea what the movie was about. I can now say that I wish I never even bothered to purchase a ticket to see this atrocity. It was the biggest waste of my time ever.I cannot tell you how many times I cringed watching this and how many times I wanted it to just end. The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all. Terrible acting, terrible movie, terrible plot line, terrible directing, terrible EVERYTHING.I HATED this movie. Avoid at all costs."," How?"
"37","Anyone But You","NatKaminska","1/10","28 December 2023","I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"," Cringe, boring comedy with paper thin romance. If this is what is called romantic and funny nowadays, then love and comedy are dead!"

I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling.

They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."," Pure escapism featuring beautiful people, beautiful locations with lots of laugh out loud moments"

"41","Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4/10","4 January 2024","Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties. Just so you know: you don't get a (proper) view of Sweeney's melons, but you do get to see a squeezed Australian glans. 4/10."," This genre needs a little more right now"
"42","Anyone But You","tm-sheehan","6/10","5 January 2024","My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."," All that glitters is not Gold"
"43","Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","7/10","6 January 2024","Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."," Light, breezy, and plenty of fun!"

"45","Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5/10","5 January 2024","Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film.

As the Maitlands try to scare the Deetz' out of their home to no avail Lydia begins seeing glimpses of them, however a fast talking lecherous con-man named Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) offers his services as a ""bio-exorcist"" to the Maitlands to get rid of the Deetzes, but Beetlejuice may be even worse than they are.Following the success of Tim Burton's debut film Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Burton became bankable enough for Warner Bros. That he became attached to the long stalled in development Batman. While Batman continued its turgid development Warner Bros. Offered Burton a number of scripts many of which he hated including the infamous Hot to Trot. Eventually Burton was given the script to Beetlejuice and decided it would be his next project. The script, originally written with a much darker and less comic edge was reworked by written Warren Skaaren and gave us the final darkly comic toned end result. The film received positive screenings from test audiences and upon release the film became a sleeper hit opening at #1 at the box office and staying there for four consecutive weeks ultimately making $74 million in North America alone against its $15 million budget which gave Warner Bros. The confidence to formally greenlight Batman which would only make Burton and even bigger name than he already was. Beetlejuice has become one of Burton's most iconic films as its undeniably the first film where Burton's signature style is fully on display (Pee-Wee's Big Adventure had glimpses, but it wasn't quite the Burton we all know). Visually creative, darkly funny, and incredibly quotable, Beetlejuice has become a classic for a good reason.At its core, the movie is a culture clash of two exaggerate types with the Maitlands represent humble, nice, down to earth people while the Deetzes represent the garish tackiness of obnoxious urbanites who revel in excess and inanity and even when they come to small towns to ""get away from it all"" their thoughts turn to ""how do we make this more like where we came from?"". Burton loves larger than life characters and he does well with the over the top likable Maitlands and the over the top tacky Deetzes but we also get a more grounded core in Winona Ryder's Lydia who despite being positioned as a gothic outsider, is also ironically the most normal and down to Earth one of the group and serves as our proxy through which we experience the supernatural shenanigans. Baldwin and Davis are both incredibly likable and have fantastic chemistry as Adam and Barbara, and Catherine O'Hara is delightfully over the top as she voices her disgust with the Maitlands home and mutilates it along with her buffoonish and foppish interior designer Otho (Glenn Shadix) who's very much a jack of all trades and a joke at all of them. But of course, we can't talk about Beetlejuice without discussing the titular character and he steals every scene he's in thanks to the manic energy brought by Keaton to the role. Very much a Bugs Bunny by way of the Cryptkeeper, Beetlejuice is repulsively funny as he's essentially this fast-talking conman with vulgar appetites and lecherous leanings that he doesn't even try to hide that culminates in a satisfying climax where everything is fully unleashed.Beetlejuice is an inverted take on Ghostbusters with the crazy surreal imagery that would become part and parcel to many a Tim Burton production. With sharp clever writing, beautifully ugly visuals, and memorable lines and characters it's no wonder why Beetlejuice's legacy has endured as long as it has."," Tim Burton's sophomore feature cements the director's iconic style with a joyfully inverted take on haunted houses and ghosts"
"52","Beetle Juice","RhapsodyReviews","9/10","7 October 2019","Review:
'Beetlejuice' is an American comedy-horror film directed by Tim Burton. These types of movie are what I wish Tim Burton would have stuck to and wish he did more of. This movie hit right home with me with the creepy Halloween feel, but also being a comedy that you could watch with the family. Yes, it has some moments of coarse language and some overly creepy scenes, but overall, I would say it's a holiday classic for the family to enjoy.
The plot revolves around a recently deceased young couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who become ghosts haunting their former home, and an obnoxious, devious poltergeist named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) from the Netherworld who tries to scare away the new inhabitants (Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder) permanently.
The acting may take some getting used to when watching a Tim Burton movie like this. It's well done in the case that the actors don't take you out of the movie and play all of there characters very well. But it's done in a way that is structure to the story that Tim Burton specifically wants to tell and it's original to its stories. The acting in this movie wasn't as play-like as some others are, but it sill didn't feel like I was watching a typical movie. I'm not trying to make this out to be a bad thing at all, I love the way I feel when watching these movies, it makes it feel more personal that the director wants to be different and have his characters stand out. My personal favorite in the film has to be Michael Keaton's portrayal of Betelgeuse, which I suppose is a good thing considering the name of the film. The way he can come off to be a complete dick, but also being super charismatic when trying to get what he wants to fantastic. Also, not to give anything away, but there is a wedding scene at the end of the movie and is amazing.
One thing that could have been turned into a negative and made this movie out to be called dated it the fact that they use stop motion when trying to do CGI, but I love it. Not only was it because of the age of this film, but it's Tim Burton M.O. All it did was turn a Tim Burton movie and make it feel more like his.
Overall, this is a Halloween movie that is on my list to watch every year. I think anyone can enjoy this movie for what it really is.
4.5/5"," Great Halloween Movie."
"53","Beetle Juice","CubsandCulture","9/10","26 September 2022","This is classic Burton. It has the macabre sense of humor and eccentric design. The film is much better as a piece of visual experience than as a story. The tone is dark whimsey. Overall this is everything you would want from a Burton film.I wish Keaton got more screen time because he is easily the best part of the film. He gives such an gonzo, over-the-top performance. Beetlejuice the character stays with you and pretty much everything out of his mouth is comedic gold. If nothing else Keaton is worth the 90 minutes it takes to watch this.The one thing I found odd or noteworthy is the young couple who's house is invaded-and thus have the audience's sympathy-is so normal, so suburban. . This is especially the case because the Ryder clan isn't-I think the contrast works in context but judging from the rest of Burton's film you would expect the two families to be reversed. That is the new family would be trying to de-weirdify the home of a couple of eccentrics because they are suburbanites. Maybe Burton felt the normal couple had to learn to be weird as a character arc but it isn't what one would expect given Burton's general vibe."," Kind of surprising that Burton sides with the yuppies."
"54","Beetle Juice","arsentiy_PA","9/10","18 October 2022","Beetlejuice is a Full-length black comedy film produced in 1988. The script, the direction and the overall style of the film is done by Tim Berton. The premise of the film isn't anything new - a haunted house. However, the perspective is different - we root for the ghosts and hope they succeed. The ghosts of previous house owners are played by Alec Boldwin and Geena Davis as Adam and Barbara Maitland. Those characters are written to be ""normal"". They are not self-righteous or mean-spirited, those two are average everyday people who are tossed in an unfamiliar world. Adam and Barbara, in fact, even struggle to scare the only inhabitant of the house that sees them - Lydia Deetz played by Winona Ryder. Delia and Charles Deetz are stepmother and father of Lydia that are played by Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones respectively. Those two are not horrible people in any way, but they are neglectful of their daughter. The concluding character of the main cast is the title character Beetlejuice, played masterfully by star actor Michael Keaton. Beetlejuice is a ghost, hired by Adam and Barbara to scare off the Deetz. Whenever Beetlejuice is on screen, he outshines everyone else. This character showcases everything that is great about this film: clever black humor, captivating acting and astonishing practical effects. He looks unpleasant, like a corpse, freshly dug from a grave. The practical effects that are used not only are memorable and unique due to Tim Berton's vision but also are cleverly used for jokes and atmosphere. However, some digital effects are clearly outdated, but not in a way of ruining the picture- it caches the eye, but you promptly forget about it in a minute or two. All of this crafts a unforgettable experience that is definitely worth seeing."," This film is one of the kind!"
"55","Beetle Juice","filipemanuelneto","9/10","31 August 2018","In this film, we will visit the afterlife through the experience of a newly deceased couple who, to their own despair, sees the home of their dreams invaded by a new family. Thus, to evict them and regain possession of their home, they decide to scare and haunt the newcomers, which can be challenging for a rookie ghost. To do this, they have the help of experienced ghosts and two unusual allies: the daughter of the new house owners and another ghost, deeply unorthodox and expert in the art of scaring the living.The film is a classic comedy of black humor, which plays with death and life in the beyond, just as it makes a great mockery to the pseudo-intellectuals of American society. The movie is very funny. I confess I had never seen or heard of him until I found him, by chance. Directed by Tim Burton, there are a lot of elements that we associate, almost instinctively, with this director: an unusual plot with offbeat themes, a comedy difficult to please everyone, out of the box sets and costumes and a refined, fun and contagious soundtrack.The cast did a great job. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin have done well in the role of the ghost couple. They interact very well with each other and have created a positive and credible romantic chemistry. Besides, they're funny. Michael Keaton has the most difficult and original character here: the spiritual de-worzler Betelgeuse (Beetle Juice), an irreverent, talkative and daring ghost who loves to scare humans and promises to be truly difficult to control when he's released. Winona Ryder, once a regular in Burton's films (remember ""Scissorhands""), is quite good at playing the rebellious daughter of the new owners of the house, which, for a reason the film never explains, has the ability to see and speak with them, as if she were a medium.Overall, this movie was a pleasant surprise. Very funny, contagious and cheerful, it will surely drive anyone to laughing laughter."," An amazing trip to the afterlife."

Beetlejuice helped demonstrate Burton's ability to make dark and somber set-ups into funny romps that can still make for some spectacular stuff on the big screen.Beetlejuice is dark fun and great pop-cinema for everyone to enjoy.

"58","Beetle Juice","Tweekums","9/10","13 September 2012","When Adam and Barbara Maitland crash their car into the river they don't know how they got back home at first; then they realise they did not survive the crash! Being dead is rather confusing even when you have the handbook. They soon figure out they can't leave the house and that doesn't seem too bad until the house is sold to the Deetz family. The Maitlands take an instant disliking to Delia Deetz in particular as she sets about deciding what alterations she must have done to make the house habitable. They attempt to scare her and her husband but they can't see them. The only person who can see them is their daughter Lydia Deetz. She tells her parents about the ghosts but obviously they don't believe her... until they put on a show during the middle of a dinner party; far from scaring them off though they think having a haunted house might be an opportunity! The Maitlands seek help, first from their afterlife case worker Juno then from Bio-Exorcist Betelgeuse (pronounced Beetle Juice). He seems more of a danger to them than the Deetz family though!This film is a lot of fun in the slightly dark way one would expect from a Tom Burton film. Michael Keaton puts in a delightfully over the top performance in the title role; having seen this I'm surprised that Burton didn't cast him as The Joker in his 'Batman' film! Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are good as the Maitlands although playing ordinary people (how just happen to be dead) they get less opportunities to show what they can do. Winona Ryder is great as Lydia; one of her earliest roles and probably the one that got her noticed by the film going public. Other notable performances come from Catherine O'Hara and Jeffery Jones as Delia and Charles Deetz and Glenn Shadix who plays Delia's strange decorator/guru Otho. The film is full of great special effects; no CGI here; just great make-up, stop go animation and puppetry. Burton's regular collaborator Danny Elfman's music fits the film perfectly. The film is definitely a comedy but there are some scary moments and a little bit of swearing that means it might not be suitable for younger children... the film may be rated '15' here in the UK but I suspect if it gets re-certificated one day it will be lowered to '12' given that it is much tamer than many '12' rated films."," Dead funny"
"59","Beetle Juice","pyrocitor","9/10","9 November 2015","Hyperbolic as it may sound, there has never quite been another film like Beetlejuice. Vomited from the maniacal mind of Tim Burton, before his name became tantamount to an adjective, the film is such a flurry of paradoxes that it really shouldn't work. But work it does, not so much bending genres as warping and distorting them like the monstrous pantomime faces scrunched by its ghostly protagonists ‚Äì a ghoulishly zany live action cartoon filled with wonderful weirdness, and an unequivocal 80s classic. Only Burton could transmogrify the horror of life after death into a rambunctiously mischievous fairy tale, but the snarkily cheerful Leave it to Beaver New England introduction proves a perfect setup to the ensuing punchline of the afterlife. Naturally, in the hands of dear Tim, the true horror of death lies not in the exquisitely realized, gruesomely surreal Dune-like wasteland of horrific stop motion leviathans, but in purgatory ultimately functioning as a garish, never-ending bureaucratic waiting room, with drawling receptionists thumbing copies of pedantic instruction manuals. The horror¬Ö the horror! Indeed, for all its zaniness and Tex Avery-style slapstick, Beetlejuice is a film brimming with surprising heart and cleverness. Burton has always been at his pitch-black, satirical best ripping apart ideologies of 'normal life', and he has a ball equally taking jabs at our goodhearted ghostly protagonists (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, both charmingly flustered), who are tickled pink by the prospect of a 'staycation' cooped up refurbishing their home, or the house's posthumous inhabitants (the deliciously demented Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara), who tastelessly claw at postmodern d√©cor or oafishly Machiavellian capitalism, goaded on by their preening design consultant Otho (the note-perfect Glen Shadix). By contrast, it's pretty easy to sympathize with their goth daughter (Winona Ryder at her surly, adorable best), who cheerfully pens suicide notes beginning with ""I am *utterly* alone"" before it was cool. This all goes without mentioning the film's star attraction: Michael Keaton, as the titular sh*t- disturbing Bio-Exorcist. Keaton's career-defining performance is truly on another level of comedic genius, as he roars through the film like a Tasmanian devil Rumplestiltskin, riffing, swearing, crotch-honking, and guzzling scenery like the demonic snake he eventually transforms into. It's a tantamount to Keaton's wacky, manic charisma that he's barely in his own movie, and yet provides one of the most unforgettable filmic characters of all time from essentially an extended cameo. And yet, the film's most bizarrely impressive accolade is, in spite of this cauldron of seething, seemingly antithetical weirdness, Burton has managed to stir up a strangely, unprecedentedly feel-good film. Somehow, in its mad tornado of satire, gorgeously oddball visuals, and adventurously eccentric performances, seasoned with Danny Elfman at his infectiously bouncy best, and sprinkled with a couple of Harry Belafonte Calypso dance numbers for good measure (naturally¬Ö), Burton's Gothic ode to the afterlife couldn't surge with more life and vibrancy. Beautifully grotesque and morbidly heartfelt, for audiences familiar or inexperienced, it's unquestionably worth reciting the name three times, and uncorking the spectacular insanity of¬Ö Beetlejuice.(It's show time!) -9.5/10"," Indoor Outhouse"

This film is full of all the weird things that go in to any Tim Burton story and it is a particularly fine example, definitely one of his best.
I think a lot of what is good about this one, that might sometimes be missing from his newer stuff, the one's I'm not so keen on, is the little jokes, the things you only notice when you're paying close attention or watching it for the umpteenth time. The magazine that spu's flyers, the football team that bears no relevance to the rest of the story, but is just funny. These are The jokes that make this film as good today as it was in 1988.
There is a lot in this film which I love and find hysterical that the politically correct censors might not pass these days as offensive, references to suicide and such, but it is a film about the afterlife and so what do you expect.Generally, it is a good fun film that probably wouldn't scare anyone under the age of ten anymore, but I think that says more about the kids than the film. It is full of laughs and Michael Keaton is superb as the title character, although sometimes his diction is really unclear.

"61","Beetle Juice","lost-in-limbo","9/10","30 June 2020","Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelge... dare I say it? Director Tim Burton would follow-up his directorial oddball debut (""PEE WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE"") with another ambitious comedy, this time something very zany, grotesque and surreal in the shape of a riotous supernatural dark spoof. As a kid I grew up watching this film, hey, I even liked the cartoon series. So re-watching it again was a sheer delight. Something I would never tire of.Burton would bring his signature visual gothic flair and live-action cartoon mannerisms to enliven the shallow, dressed up lifestyles in ""BEETLEJUICE"", but what really makes the feature is the very loose performance of Michael Keaton as Betelgeuse. Keaton is outstanding in bringing this outrageously rotten character to life, from being menacing, charming the ladies, or simply exorcising a wise-crack. He's truly a head-spin. While he provides a huge impact, the Beetlejuice character doesn't really get a whole lot of screen time, despite his importance to the plot's progression. It's measured in bursts, as his character is virtually a punch-line with legs. But with that in mind, I think it works because Burton never overplays his hand, which makes Keaton's conman persona effective than say overbearing. I don't know if Burton would do the same thing these days.Anyway the narrative was always about Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin's recently deceased young rural couple adapting to the afterlife, while at the same time doing their best to frighten the house's new city-folk occupants that have ideas of changing their new home to meet their own trendy needs. So in a last ditch effort to scare them off they seek help from a freelance bio-exorcist ghost known as Betelgeuse. The compulsive plotting won't surprise (even though Burton throws up an interesting view of the afterlife), but what stands out is the wonderful set-pieces (how can you not grove along to the dinner party sequence as The Banana Boat Song plays), eccentric practical effects (loved the clay-animation), inspired pastel set-designs and wrapping it all together is Danny Elfman's enchantingly whimsical music score. One colorful dimension after another, but even with its comic flourishes it still demonstrates a nasty wickedness.Add to that an amusing cast, peppered with character actors and zesty interplays. Davis and Baldwin were likably good. Jeffery Jones is enjoyably clueless and Catherine O'Hara makes a great ice queen. Winona Ryder is fittingly deadpan as the very aware gothic teenage daughter and Glen Shadix entertains as the family's psychic friend. Also showing up in a memorable part is Silva Sidney as an afterlife caseworker.""BEETLEJUICE"" is a decorative haunted house fun ride and one of Burton's best."," ""You're working with a professional here!"""

This¬Öis another reason (from above) that I am truly looking forward to a sequel with a large budget and perfected CGI, if necessary. (Actually, I'm against most CGI ‚Äì I like real heart and efforts from what I see in film, but some is necessary to showcase a larger world, √† la Lord of the Rings.)But, beyond the beyond cartoons, the movie was brilliant.

"65","Beetle Juice","talarisw","9/10","15 September 2012","Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors of all time. You can say he's Hollywood's ""goth"" director because he's known for his dark, macabre and surreal style. This is one of his best known films, possibly his signature film next to Edward scissor-hands and The nightmare before Christmas. Even though this is one of the most unique, creative and imaginative films ever, it does have one major flaw, much of the story simply dosen't make sense. Let me start by saying this film is a unique take on ghost comedies. Even though the movie's titled Beetlejuice, the main characters are really the Maitlands, played by great actors Alec Baldwin as Adam and Gena Davis as Barbra, who are an old fashioned couple who drowns in the start of the film. Davis and Baldwin are great in their roles in playing an un-hip, boring and naive couple, which perfectly clashes with the more unconventional Deetz family and you understand their motives. Burton has a fascination with the dead and I love his unique take on the afterlife. Here the afterlife is run like a bureaucratic business, the Maitlands are given ""The handbook for the recently deceased"" which is a thick boring book about instructions for living in the afterlife. And later they go to the main office of the afterlife, where they have to take a number and wait to be called and then there'll meet their caseworker Juno. The Maitlands find out that their trapped in their own house as ghost, if they try to leave the house they go to a bizarre place call Saturn and meet a giant sand-worm. I love how Tim gave a memorable twist to your average ghost comedy with the ghost being the one haunted by the living. I love how Tim created the Deetz family who moved in the old Maitland's home. The step-mom is Delia played wonderfully by Catherine O'Hara who dominates the family. I love her Gothic art work and she looks kinda sexy here. I love Jeffery Jones as the ""I don't want to get involved"" dad. And there's Winona Ryder as the depressed, suicidal teenager Lydia, who dresses like everyday's a funeral. This is one of Ryder's best performances and Lydia is interesting as she's the only person who can see ghost and would rather be friends with the dead then the living. And last but not least there's Micheal Keaton as Beetlejuice. Tim's a good story teller but unconventional. The title character dosen't appear until well after 40 minutes into the movie. I think he has only a total of 17 minutes of screen time in this movie, which sounds bad for a title character but like in Batman(also stared Keaton as the title character),where the title character dosen't appear a lot, Tim makes it work well. In a way everything is a much needed build up to introducing Beetlejuice. Keaton gives his best & most manic comedic performance. Beetlejuice is one of the most unique and memorable characters of all time. He's a deranged, erratic acting, gross and perverted ghost. But the bad thing is that he's such an interesting character but Tim never really explains anything about him. Juno explains he use to be her assistant but then became a bio-exorcist, claiming he can ""get rid of the living"". But that's all he explains about him. Why do you have to say his name three times before he can appear? Why is he trapped in the model Adam created? What kind of a name is Beetlejuice? Why does he spell his name Beetlegeise?, Why couldn't he tell Lydia his name?, What's his cause of death?, How old is he? Who was he before he died?, Why does he have to marry Lydia in order to be free? and Why is he more powerful then other ghost we see? Unfortunley none of these questions are answered. In fact a lot of the story dosen't make sense, like Juno telling the Maitlands that the living can't see the dead but later she tells them to scare the Deetz by creating scary faces and Lydia can see them. It's also unclear weather Beetlejuice is supposed to be a villain or some anti-hero. I personally look at him as a bad guy. But if you overlook the fact that a lot of the plot is incoherent this is a very enjoyable film. The film is visually great! Tim's surreal visual are some of the best of surrealism's I ever seen. The calypso songs works well into the movie. Danny Elfman's score is great, it sounds like a manic circus. I also like the cheesy looking special effects. One of the highlights are seeing the other dead people and their look mirroring their death, like the receptionist who slit her wrist, the sexy woman cut in half and Juno who's throat's slit. Tim is able to make humor out of a grim subject like death. He even makes Lydia's attempt at suicide humorous. Warner Bros. really missed an opportunity to do a sequel to this film, maybe they could've explain more about Beetlejuice. Never the less a ghost comedy classic."," A newly deceased couple hate the new family that moved in their old house, so they call upon a deranged ghost named Beetlejuice to scare them off ."
"66","Beetle Juice","Steffi_P","9/10","4 April 2011","It's difficult to make a truly scary horror these days, simply because the staples of the genre have become so familiar culturally. A Dracula in a dinner jacket or Frankenstein's monster with a bolt through his neck nowadays appear more comical than creepy. And there's always been a fine line between what frightens us and what makes us laugh ‚Äì in both cases it's the twisted and the offbeat. Perhaps this is why horror spoofs have the potential to be so rich and enjoyable.Beetlejuice takes a cunning idea for its story, with similarities to classic afterlife fantasy pictures like Here Comes Mr Jordan, but with an Addams Family slant thrown into the mix. The development of this plot was not a straightforward one. Michael McDowell's original script was much darker and more violent, and somewhat more complex. As well as adding a good-natured comedic tone, the Warren Skaaren rewrite is incredibly succinct in its storytelling. The Maitlands are introduced with expert brevity ‚Äì in just a couple of minutes and a few lines of dialogue we know all about their idyllic lifestyle, and their only regret being that they don't have children. The narrative then wastes no time in killing them off and getting the real story going. How many lesser pictures would have faffed around for ten or fifteen minutes before getting to this crucial plot point? Integral to the overall look of Beetlejuice is its having been directed by Tim Burton. Credits may go to various individuals for production design and visual effects, but it's fairly clear they are all working from Burton's own sketches. In interviews Burton often claims to have little formal knowledge of classic cinema, but his tribute to German expressionism is especially clear in this picture, although for Burton it is largely employed for his own bizarre aesthetics. Incidentally I also spy a nod towards the work of Dutch painter Vermeer in the shot where Lydia writes her would-be suicide note. And there's much more to Burton's visual scheme than simple design. He often begins a scene with close-ups or mid-shots, rather than a wide, establishing shot, so that we don't really get a proper impression of the space in which the action is taking place. Another ace director Milos Forman (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus) uses a similar tactic, but whereas Forman does it to focus us more on the performances, Burton's aim seems to be largely to disconcert and disorientate the viewer. After all, Burton does emphasise the settings, throwing in bizarrely angled outdoor shots and props overhanging the foreground. Again it's all calculated to make the movie's world as weird as possible. But none of this is ever exaggerated enough to distract us from story and character.Not that we are likely to lose sight of characters when the acting performances are so attention-grabbing. At the heart of it all is Michael Keaton's wild portrayal of the titular antagonist. There's so much going on in his performance ‚Äì look at the range of facial twitches he goes through in the few seconds after Adam says he has a few questions. Keaton is also a great improviser, and thought up with a lot of his own material here. You can tell when he's improvising, because he comes out with stuff you just couldn't script ‚Äì example: ""Now that is why I never do two shows in a night. I just won't do it, I won't."" It wouldn't work on paper but it's hilarious coming out of Keaton's mouth. The other stand out is Sylvia Sidney who gets a small cameo. Not many modern viewers know Sidney, but she was a lead actress back in the 1930s, usually a warm-hearted romantic figure and quite the opposite of this grouchy old lady. Still, she brings the necessary memorable impact to her small but important role. Honourable mentions also go to jolly character actor Jeffrey Jones and the appropriately oddball Glenn Shadix, who sadly died last year.The icing on the cake is that Beetlejuice is filled with inspired touches that make it stand out from the crowd, little ideas that are not strictly required by the story but elevate it from some wacky spoof into a horror-comedy classic. There's the use of stop-motion animation, which Burton has long championed. Stop-motion doesn't look especially realistic, but compared to CGI it has a kind of life to it (if you'll excuse the metaphor). Then there's the complete non-sequitur use of Harry Belafonte songs. There's nothing remotely horror-themed about Day-O or Jump in the Line (apart from the tenuous link between Afro-Caribbean culture and zombies) but it doesn't really matter. Beetlejuice is a horror-comedy let loose, in which anything can happen, and frequently does. And that's what makes it so fine."," ""The strange and unusual"""

After a minor car accident, both of them drown and the house is sold... but unfortunately the couple still ""lives"" on inside the home alongside the annoying new family. How can they scare the newcomers away? I watched this film on Halloween 2007 for two reasons -- first, because you need to watch scary movies on Halloween (although I think this is really more of a comedy). But second, because Robert Goulet had passed on a few days before, and I felt it would only be right and proper to honor the man who had made such an impression in my life after seeing him sing live in 2002.As far as I know, this film marks the first Tim Burton and Michael Keaton collaboration, before they both went on to make the two best Batman films in history (at least until Chris Nolan came around). We also have Jeffrey Jones, another regular and the music by Danny Elfman from Oingo Boingo. Winona Ryder (from Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands"") is here, and this is by far her greatest role. Maybe her only truly great role, in fact, as this is the way I like to remember her... not so much as Spock's mother.Tim Burton was perfect to direct this film, giving him a range of weird and grotesque things to work with, weird clay stuff and wild architecture. It's like the peak of his career because it's as strange as ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" and as dark as any of his films... all of which were perfect until he picked ""Planet of the Apes"" and his career died a brutal death (with the post-Apes exception of ""Big Fish"" and perhaps ""Big Eyes"").That is what you get here, though: comedy and the macabre, mixed together... a world where suicide victims get to spend the afterlife as civil servants... and your death wound stays visible forever. (Drowning seems to have been a good choice to avoid looking awful.) Michael Keaton at his dirtiest (think ""Night Shift"" and not ""Mr. Mom""). Oh, and Harry Belafonte's ""Banana Boat Song""... you need that.So, should you see it? The real question is why haven't you already? Any horror fan will appreciate this, as will any Tim Burton fan. The feel of this film is fun and fresh even two decades later. There is a special edition 20th anniversary DVD, which also offers a few episodes of the cartoon for some reason.

All the imagination comes out in this wonderful film. It's a black comedy, although not too dark to be called ""bleak."" In a way, it's actually very cartoonish, thanks to Burton's brilliant direction that leads to many surreal scenes. Beetlejuice himself is a marker of insanity, his contrasts to the main characters are visible from a mile away. While Beetlejuice is a filthy, loudmouthed, perverted, and ultimately quite twisted, the Maitland's are calm and down to Earth, acting much like they would had they never even died. Each character in this film has their own unique quirk, even the ""extras"" that appear in the afterlife. Many nameless characters are memorable just by their looks.With all of Burton's madness running amok, it's hard not to laugh or delight over the exquisite detail put into the films finer work. While the special effects may not ""wow,"" the stop motion is great and represents Burton's style in a very refined way, and the makeup is still impressive years later, especially the scene where Adam and Barbara are briefly resurrected. No wonder it won an Oscar for it.The biggest problem I have with Beetlejuice is that I felt if they had added a little more time on, some ideas hinted at could be realized in a better way. There are many ideas that are called attention to, but ultimately ignoured. Even the malevolent sandworms and their nameless homeland are mentioned and shown, but their purpose or origin are never explained. Beetlejuice himself raises some questions as well, where he's from, how he got into the Maitland's house, and there are some plot holes considering how to resurrect him; by saying his name Three Times, yet they never explain why *he* can't say his name, and if saying it three times resurrects him or gives him power, why does saying it again banish him?

Well, actually...the Dietzes are a family you'd probably WANT to see dead. The Maitlands? They already are.Barbara Maitland (Geena Davis) and her husband, Adam (Alec Baldwin), have just moved into a sweet little country house, when the unthinkable happens...thanks to a freak car accident, the whole line about ""till Death do us part"" has actually taken on a whole new meaning for them. But they've been parted from life, not from each other. And if you're thinking that death is all that different from the life they just left behind, think again. The Afterlife can be just as fraught with complications and peril, not the least of which finds the poor couple stranded in an 'alternative universe'-version of their house.Enter the Dietzes. Pretentious, social-status fixated richies Charles (Jeffrey Jones) and Delia (Catherine O'Hara) and their Goth-obsessed daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder), who proceed to turn the Maitlands' quaint little cottage into an avant-garde nightmare that only Hieronymus Bosch - or Salvador Dali - could love. What are two frustrated, spatially-stranded spooks to do? There's actually a sort of ""Health and Haunted Services"" system in the Great Beyond that provides assistance in the form of caseworkers (who are about as helpful in death as they are in life), and Adam and Barbara's ""help"" comes in the form of the cynical and cancerous Juno, (the great Sylvia Sidney), who goes completely by the book...but does tip the deceased darlings off to one dangerously unpredictable possibility for a resolution of their problem.His name, as you know by now, is Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) - or as more commonly known - ""Beetlejuice."" He's a caseworker turned ""independent contractor"", which means he's bad news for the Maitlands, worse news for the Dietzes, and the best thing to happen to horror-comedies since three guys named Venkman, Spengler and Stanz. Say his name three times, and let the mirthful mayhem begin!Audiences couldn't get enough of Tim Burton's uniquely twisted perspective on the world after his first major movie, PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE exploded onto movie screens, and no one knew what to expect for his follow-up. Good thing, too, because there was no way to anticipate or explain this screwy and satisfying story of ghosts being haunted by a living family more scary than they are, and the outrageous entity out to fleece them both for his own purposes, (not the least of which is to get a little cuddle time in with the languishingly lovely Lydia.)How a literal army of writers managed to put together a script this good is beyond me, but after multiple viewings, this is still Number One for the title of Funniest Frightfest around.Burton was laying the groundwork for his revolving company of players with BEETLEJUICE as well. Besides Jeffrey Jones as the nerd-alert of a husband, there's Glenn Shadix as the fey Otho, Delia's co-designer/co-conspirator in making over the Maitlands' house and the ""exorcism"" that follows, and Ryder, of course, in her breakout role which would be followed by her turn in HEATHERS, guaranteeing her status as the Eighties' ""It "" girl.And besides the trademark hallucinogenic visuals and blackly funny sense of humor, there was that casting. Bringing Davis, Baldwin and the manic Keaton together was a masterstroke of both luck and genius, and who else could take Sylvia Sidney, Robert Goulet and DICK CAVETT, put them in the same movie and actually make them ""cool?"" It certainly wouldn't be the last time he would make that feat happen, but the timing and the end result would arguably never be more perfect.BEETLEJUICE is a must-have for any movie library, whether you collect comedy OR horror.

Beetlejuice is just so weird that he is almost lovable. What makes these characters work is the writing.The plot is very consistent, if seeming a bit weird and far fetched to begin, with plenty of dark humour and amazing characters. There is plenty of physical comedy and some slapstick which spreads the humour through different characters. The dialogue is pitched well, also giving some cheesy but really likable puns on the dead.The ideology of ghosts is covered well, playing on human interpretations and putting twists and turns on this idea, and making it funny through a book for the dead.The settings make this different to, with a different look upon heaven and hell, and the model of the town plays a great small yet significant setting. The colour and lighting hep achieve the dark and sinister feel of the narrative, as does the Oscar winning make up.Tim Burton has created some wonderful films in his directing career, and whereas this film isn't as powerful as Sweeney Todd or Edward Scissorhands, it is easily the funniest and a joy to watch"," Burton's funny horror is also deliciously dark"

It has a kooky, cockeyed sensibility and a rhythm that is by turns easy, lazy and frenetic. A charming couple in New England die and come back to their beloved home as ghosts, determined to rid the place of the horrendous new tenants. Possibly the most benign and engaging performance ever by Alec Baldwin; Geena Davis, Winona Ryder and Sylvia Sidney are also very appealing. The new couple from New York who take over the house (Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara) aren't as well written or thought-out as the other characters and some of their bemused, dry-ice comic lines take a few seconds to reach you. Of course, there's Michael Keaton, wildly comic as Betelgeuse. I recall hearing comments back in 1988 that Keaton wasn't around enough to make the picture worthwhile, but that's only if you watch the film for the fast quips and sight-gags. Keaton is truly wonderful, but he's also bombastic, and I felt there was just enough of him to satisfy--it's really not his story anyway, it belongs to Baldwin and Davis; Betelgeuse is used as a horny, vulgar punchline. Director Tim Burton is very careful not to overload the movie with raunch; he is surprisingly careful in setting up this story, and he works magic within a dubious scenario: a comic fantasy about dead folks which ultimately celebrates life. ***1/2 from ****"," Has a crazy rhythm all its own"

"85","Beetle Juice","nickenchuggets","8/10","5 November 2021","Putting aside the controversy surrounding Alec Baldwin recently, most people who take the time to watch this movie are in for one of his most memorable performances. Although I've known about this movie for about a decade, I never actually realized who was playing the main characters. As is typically the case with Tim Burton films, Beetlejuice has an unmistakably macabre atmosphere underlying its whole storyline. It's not really a violent movie, but because it does have death as a central theme, it's not as much of a mere kids movie as you would think. The movie starts by introducing us to a couple who are on vacation in New England. Adam and Barbara Maitland (Baldwin and Geena Davis respectively), are pretty happy with the house they have picked for their getaway this year, but once they decide to go for a drive, things suddenly get real bad. Their car smashes into a wooden tunnel structure overlooking a river and the car sinks into the water. After Adam and his wife arrive home, they find a small book that has mysteriously showed up on its own even though it wasn't there earlier. The topic of the book concerns itself with recently deceased humans. Adam and Barbara are now convinced that they're actually dead, and their suspicions are proven to be right when they discover other people are incapable of seeing them. The people in question are an obnoxious New York family called the Deetzes, who have just bought the house Adam and his wife were using for their vacation. While the Deetzes are, for lack of a better word, unpleasant, one member of their family does prove herself useful. Their teenage daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) is a devout follower of goth culture and dresses in nothing but black. Because she seems more attuned to supernatural and ghostly occurrences than her parents, she is able to see and converse with the ghosts of Adam and Barbara. Soon, the ghost couple is brought to a strange, otherworldly place that resembles a doctor's waiting room. Here, they are told by their personal caseworker Juno (Sylvia Sidney) that only they are capable of forcing the Deetzes out of their vacation house. Because they're ghosts now, the obvious course of action is to scare them out, but because they can't be physically seen, this is way easier said than done. Thankfully, there just so happens to be just the type of person they need in the form of Beetlejuice; an eccentric madman who died sometime in the 1300s but can still be seen wandering around every so often. There is a miniature model village in the attic of the Deetz house, and this is where he is located. When the Maitlands are shrunk down in order to meet Beetlejuice, they don't look too happy to see him. As a person, Beetlejuice is crude, morbid, and unpredictable. Still, if enlisting his help is what the Maitlands need to expel the Deetzes, they are willing to take their chances with him. Beetlejuice proceeds to successful scare the family, since he is actually visible to them. However, they manage to discover the same book Adam and Barbara found, which apparently contains instructions on how to summon specific dead people. Adam and Barbara are (unwillingly) brought back to the world of the living, and Lydia (being a friend of them by this point) is forced to interfere. She begs Beetlejuice to let Adam and his wife stay dead, but he declines to help unless Lydia agrees to marry him. By marrying a mortal woman, Beetlejuice will be free to cause absolute havoc in the human realm. Lydia has no choice but to agree, and after Beetlejuice returns Adam and Barbara to their ghost state, he prepares to marry Lydia. Mere seconds before the makeshift ceremony is completed, Beetlejuice is killed by Barbara. With his threat vanquished, the Maitlands and Deetzes finally put their differences aside and live together in the house. Now that the (rather convoluted) storyline is finished I think I would like to discuss the various inadequacies that are to be found in this movie. While I thought it was pretty good, it does have a minor but noticeable annoyance, that being the fact that Adam and Barbara don't look any different when they're dead. I know it would be pretty obnoxious to have them cloaked in a spectral blue aura for the whole film to show that they're ghosts, but they basically look like normal humans even in the afterlife. Aside from this, Baldwin and Geena manage to deliver a competent performance which benefits from the macabre sense of humor Burton puts into most of his movies. Winona Ryder as Lydia is a good portrayal of someone who acts a mediator between her skeptical, ghost-hating parents and the ghosts themselves. She possesses a different behavior than her parents, one that is more open minded to paranormal activity, which is why the Maitlands see her as exactly what they were looking for. Not to mention, Ryder herself thought that being in this movie would be a good idea but she was called a witch by her acquaintances instead, which everyone agrees is uncalled for. Last (but certainly not least) we have Michael Keaton as the title character. Beetlejuice, while not appearing physically until pretty far into the movie, is probably the main character. He's unstable and quite ridiculous, but promises the Maitlands a solution to their Deetz problem. As it turns out, he just uses them as a diversion to pull himself into the world of the living (which he ultimately fails at). This makes it debatable whether or not he really ever liked the Maitlands or just viewed them as fools. In any case, Beetlejuice (the movie) is a surprisingly well made film which manages to combine horror and comedy quite well. As expected, I'm pretty disappointed with myself for not watching it earlier, especially because I knew about it for so long.

"87","Beetle Juice","Prismark10","8/10","17 November 2022","Beetlejuice is the movie that marked Tim Burton as a director to watch. It allowed Michael Keaton to freewheel his comedy chops at a higher level.The combination of Burton, Keaton, composer Danny Elfman, the production design and animation in this movie convinced Warner Brothers that this was the right team for Batman.Adam Maitland (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara Maitland (Geena Davis) live in their dream house until they one day die in a freak car accident.When they come back to their home they find out that they are dead and have been for some time. Their house is now occupied by another family who plan to bring big changes to it.The Maitlands are unable to scare the family away. Only Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) sees them and understand their predicament.They then bring in a bio-exorcist ghost Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) who runs amok. Now the Maitlands have to rein him in.For Hollywood, Beetlejuice is bizarre, freaky and surreal. It has a manic and pervy performance from Keaton. He is very much a supporting character here as the villain in this creepy comedy.Burton plays homage to other horror films, he brings in veteran Sylvia Sidney as the afterlife spiritual guide who knows all about the chaos Betelgeuse could unleash. The afterlife as a civil service bureaucracy seems to be inspired from Powell and Pressburger.The special effects might have now aged, a lot of it was stop motion animation. The dark inventiveness of the movie still stands up."," Beetlejuice"

Its quick, its unique and above all its hilarious and lovable as hell!Tim Burton's stop motion is extraordinary yet again (surprising no-one) and the overall performances are from pretty good to great! The Sylvia Sidney cameos are probably the best parts of the movie. She has by far the best lines. Also, Michael Keaton is great, but Alec Baldwin and young Winona Ryder have a more normal role and managed to be memorable as well!"," Quick Review"
"89","Beetle Juice","Screen_Blitz","8/10","11 October 2017","Mixing elements of Gothic horror and comedy can be a tricky stunt to pull off. Director Tim Burton however, manages to do just that in more than ways one. And if you know the director well enough, you'd know that resorting to usual Hollywood conventions isn't part of his norm. We are talking about a director takes his quirky vision and places it full-throttle to create an entertaining horror-comedy feast that supplements both laughs and scares. His vision is what makes this quirky, yet effectively engaging Gothic horror piece work. Imagine a world where Michael Keaton played a goofy green- haired lunatic that made The Joker look like a cute little snuggle doll by comparison. This concept is brought to life in this infectiously bizarre comedy- horror salad that see Burton exercising his signature style to full extent, pushing the boundaries of youngsters' dark imaginations, but not without having his tongue in his cheek. This film follows Adam (played by Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (played by Geena Davis), a married couple who are driving on a bridge when they swerve off-course while dodging a poor little dog. When the fall ends up killing them, they wake up in the afterlife where their house is being a sold by a family consisting couple Charles and Delia Deetz (played by Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara respectively) and their emo teen daughter Lydia (played by Winona Ryder). Since they (Adam and Barbara) are ghosts, Charles and Deila can't see or hear them. However, it is Lydia who has the mysterious ability to communicate with them. In an effort they scare the family out of there house, the couple must cross paths with an erratic, fast-talking clown only known as Beetlejuice (played by Michael Keaton). It is only too bad that the clown has a more devious plan they do more harm than good. Wacky and peculiar are the most suitable words to describe what kind of ride you are in for. But as this is Tim Burton, bizarre is what most people should expect. This features Michael Keaton in a role that defies against the usual good guy tapestry that he would resort to later on his career. Keaton exercises the role of the quirky clown-being with appropriate over-the-topness and macabre-type comedic energy that lends plenty of humor to leave audiences snickering beneath the dark Gothic nature of his character and the film itself. The movie has moments of laughter, but most certainly not in the way that will leave you busting your gut with guffaws. After all, it is dark humor that defines the underlining comedic tone while the spooky imagery triumphs over the absurd wackiness. To be more specific, the vast portion of the imagery lies within the world of the afterlife where Adam and Barbara encounter deceased victims who have faced very unpleasant deaths such as a man who has been burnt to meat, an elderly lady who smokes and exhales through the slit in her throat, a headless man, and a later sequence when one of the characters is tasked to pop her eyes out of her skull. And yet this film somehow managed to pass with a PG-rating in an era that introduced the PG-13 rating by the release of the war film 'Red Dawn', not to mention that Keaton also drops an F-bomb in one scene. Nonetheless, Tim Burton brings an expert hand at keeping things moving, and Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis sell themselves in their roles just fine. If there is any detriment to Burton's vision, it is, of course, time as the special effects he incorporates some sequences such as the lead couple being chased by a giant sandworm has grown hideously outdated. And the musical number at the end feels somewhat out of place. But whether Burton is trying to frighten us with his nightmarish imagery or amuse us with the quirky nature of the characters, particularly the eponymous character, he is always inviting us in for the laughs.Beetlejuice is an entertaining piece that mixes comedy and horror in an eccentric fashion that truly works. With all grotesqueness that showers the film, some may question whether it makes for an appropriate children's movie. For my answer, probably not without parental guidance unless the youngsters who dare to watch this are immune to nightmares induced from Tim Burton's campy visual imagery. But with the macabre humor injected into the film's veins, there is enough camp to make for a nice treat for both adults and preteen children alike."," Tim Burton's spooky tongue-in-cheek vision effectively sells this Gothic horror comedy in life"

"92","Beetle Juice","christophershobris","8/10","25 September 2015","Tim Burton certainly has the most unusual way of bringing his films across. Either that is his artistic style or he has to based on the screenplays he chooses to direct. Either way, he does an outstanding job and this film really enhances what talent he possesses. Burton certainly is known for his weird visions of what he puts on screen. Beetlejuice also stands out by the performance by the main stars like Alec Baldwin in a breakout performance that launched his film career, and Geena Davis for her charming feminine characteristic. But the one that stands out the most is Michael Keaton as Betelgeuse. In a masterful portrayal and brilliantly acted despite being underneath all that make-up and costume. This is a true tour-De-force for Keaton with his best performance of his monumental career. The negatives I have for it is the story is not well understood at least for me. And the other performers didn't deliver all that much. Ryder was good, Jeffrey Jones was good in a Ferris Bueller-type role which fits him well. But O'Hara was a little flat, and certainly saw someone else playing that character. Everyone else was eh, OK I guess.

This is the case with Beetlejuice, just a funny, very well made movie that never gets old.One thing I really like about this movie is the awesome use of practical effects and makeup. The people in charge of this really did a great job that I believe should always be appreciated in a film. Also, Michael Keaton in this movie: beyond hilarious. I'm giving the movie an 8/10 because it doesn't always make sense and I know it's not supposed to but there are a few things in the movie that just don't really add up.

Keaton creates a character that is incredibly mad, and attractive because of this.His performance is the truest epitome of what Tim Burton has been trying to capture on screen ever since.

I mean, the man is a cornucopia of ideas. I'm not sure what I expected this to be like, but I could easily not have gotten it right even if I had countless guesses. The plot is marvelous, and develops nicely, always retaining interest. The pacing is spot-on. I never really wanted this to end, and it somehow both left me satisfied and hungry for more of the same. The characters are magnificent. The ""feel"" of one of his productions is definitely there, and without it seeming too much like one of his others. The acting is great. The music, both Elfman's scoring and in general, all excellent. The humor varies, and I, personally, did not find everything funny, but quite a bit of the material that worked had me laughing an awful lot. The visuals, as we know they will be, when Tim is helming it, are invariably well-done. The effects are perhaps outdated today, but they still work and do so well. And honestly, as I watched this, I was far too entertained to care if I could tell how they did this or that. The dialog is well-written, with several clever lines. The designs are rich. The details... wow. There are some grotesque images in this, a little language, moderate and strong, and a suggestive thing or two. The DVD features a theatrical trailer and a music-only track. I recommend this warmly to any fan of Tim Burton and his style. 8/10"," Why aren't more films this original?"

"97","Beetle Juice","ElMaruecan82","8/10","22 March 2020","A wacky Tim Burton at a time when his muse Johnny Depp was still the thug-arresting hearthrob of ""21 Jump Street"", a sweet Geena Davis, a boyish Alec Baldwin and practical Gremlins-like special effects... well, if ""Beetlejuice"" doesn't scream 80s, I don't know what it does. This is a little gem of horror mixed with comedy that might delight every member of the family though I suspect kids who've grown up after the 2000s might find the film a bit too silly and childish... a complain they'd share with eminent critics of that era such as Ebert and Siskel. Both deplored that the titular character brought too much obnoxiousness to an already loaded story and they got rapidly tired of his antics, but didn't they think the same of ""Ace Ventura""?I think ""Beetlejuice"" is a film that might disorient the first-time viewer because of its constant swinging between fantasy and horror and naughty comedy, but I suspect this is the kind of experience that grows on you if you give it a chance. Michael Keaton as ""Beetlejuice"" might be a tad too prankish and annoying but thankfully he only appears midway through the film and meanwhile, the main characters had already won our hearts. I agree that the relationship between Baldwin and Davis brings a certain sweetness to the film sometimes at the expenses of the plot. I couldn't really accept that such lovely persons would indulge to scare the new occupants on their residence just because of some disturbance... especially since they aren't played by the least likable actors either.Jeffrey Jones aka Emperor Joseph aka Ferris' archenemy Rooney is a serene father who wants to contemplate birds and enjoy his nest of serenity, Catherine O'Hara, aka Kevin's mom is the lady of the house eccentric sculptor who won't have any intruders disrupt her oasis of artistic creativity and finally, Winona Ryder is the emo malcontent adolescent who grows an interest on the former residents, if not a liking.In fact, if we except the nasty decorator Otho, the character who comes the closest to an antagonist is Beetlejuice himself, though his main purpose is to get the house rid of the family by operating let's say an exorcism from the other side. The premise is interesting but the film is filled with so many enchanting special effects and funny scenes that a new character popping up near the end wasn't a necessity. As hard as it is to imagine the film without Beetlejuice, it's funny that the film's most memorable moments don't feature him. But I won't get too nitpicky, Keaton is obviously playing a career-defining role and I suspect if it wasn't for his performance, he might not have caught the attention of Burton for his next project (a clue: it's another special effect movie with a one-word title starting with ""B"").Keaton is certainly as wacky and crazy as his cartoon adaptation but his performance is too straight-forward and doesn't call for subtlety, a pity for a film that contains so many inspiring moments such as the afterlife bureaucracy and the memorable case-worker played by a chain-smoking and scene-stealing Sylvia Sidney.At the peak of its creativity, ""Beetlejuice"" is a fantastic and spectacular fantasy entertainment filled with hilarious moments: a great twist at the end of the opening credits, a hilarious choregraphy with the ""Banana-Boat Song"" and a funny waiting room sequence involving a silly-looking creature with a shrunk head. The film won an Oscar for Best Make-up but oddly enough, it didn't garner any Golden Globe nomination for Best Comedic Actor to Keaton. I must admit his performance never really bothered me except for one moment that carried a lot of gravitas (when the couple's ghosts started to age and their bodies turning into skeletons), the scene hit a really sensitive chord and it did so well that I really wanted someone to get rid of Beetlejuice instead of the humans. For that scene in particular I would agree with Ebert's criticism.But with some perspective, ""Beetlejuice"" is a fun product of its time, with a right balance of humor (mostly visual), heart and special effects, and these aspects work so much that the cynicism brought by the titular character might feel like the real intrusion. There are moments where the house looks overcrowded and the humor overdone but ""Beetlejuice"" is still one of these little classics of the 80s, and time did justice to the little films of that glorious and extravagant decade."," Wacky Horror Picture Show..."

This is one of those 80's CLASSIC's i grew up on along with the likes of Ghostbusters 1&2 & Death Becomes Her, among others, these were fun, spooky comedies full of fantastic special effects that were great for it's time well before c.g.i completely took over & the fx back then actually were special!!!
Tim Burton crafted a beautifully designed fantasy Horror comedy, the visual look is fantastic with it's big gothic cartoony style & colourful sets & incredible creature designs, this is Burton at his creative best in my opinion!!!
The atmosphere is nightmare weird & cartoony strange but not in a threatening way, it's more a fun fantasy feel to the film with many creative bits popping out at you.
The cast is great fun & so memorable.
Especially BeetleJuice himself!!!
Michael Keaton is excellent in his most iconic role as the crazy-menacing & hilarious evil spirit ""BeetleJuice"" his performance is legendary now & he's full of life for a dead guy lol, he's great fun.BeetleJuice is a pure 80's CLASSIC movie, i grew up loving this on video & also collected all the Awesome action figures from the movie, great nostalgia for this fun, gothic Horror-comedy.
This is Director Tim Burton at his absolute best in my opinion!!!
The big haunted house is a beautiful set peice & the production design of the supernatural otherworldly sets are incredible!!!
Also the music is BEAUTIFUL, especially the opening scenes it's just beautifully done.
This film makes me long for that lovely lost era of the 80's & early 90's my favourite times as i grew up in those simpler times with these CLASSIC movies.
There's some absolute classic scenes in this film such as the waiting room scene full of freaky spirits & the big scary BeetleJuice snake scene, superb moments in a a superb movie.

"100","Beetle Juice","MaxBorg89","8/10","18 February 2008","It's only his second movie, and yet it is obvious Beetle Juice is pure, unmistakable Tim Burton: macabre, darkly comic and crammed with weirdos, not least Michael Keaton's career-best performance as the perverted titular ""bio-exorcist"".But what does a creature like that actually do? Well, it depends on who requires his services: in the case of Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis), a recently deceased married couple, he is supposed to get rid of the ""terrible people"" (Jeffrey Jones and Helen O' Hara) who have taken over their house. As his employers will soon discover, though, Beetlejuice doesn't exactly play by the rules and has an agenda of his own, a fact that could cause more damage than expected. Unless the new owner's daughter, the death-obsessed Lydia (Winona Ryder), finds a way to stop him, that is.Burton was famously accused for favoring style over content in his two Batman films (fair assessment, but they're still awesome), something that can't be said of this black comedy: the visual element may be incredibly strong, especially in the fantasy sequences, but the director never loses track of the wonderfully witty script, taking the audience with him on a trip that, similarly to his later work Corpse Bride, paints a merrier portrait of the afterlife than we are used to imagine, albeit with the occasional grotesque scenarios and people.Oddly enough, the extravagant imagery is also where the film shows its biggest limit, as some of the special effects have dated quite badly, most notably a stop-motion animated snake that attacks Adam and Barbara in an early nightmare scene. Such shortcomings, however, are compensated by the consistent twisted humor and a committed cast: Baldwin and Davis are amusing in roles few people would imagine them playing, Burton-regular Jones is a reliable source of laughs and Ryder's ""troubled"" teenager (not like her Heathers character, though) is a neat and charming counterpoint to her heartbreaking turn in Edward Scissorhands, also directed by Burton. But it is the underused Keaton (about 18 minutes of screen time in an almost two-hour long movie) who deserves the hot spot in the audience's memory: he is twitchy, rude, dirty and VERY naughty - nearly too much for a PG feature. And if that isn't enough, consider this: Burton wanted him and no one else to play Batman because of his work in this picture, and the result was the finest celluloid Dark Knight until Christian Bale took over the suit. That's gotta mean something, right?"," Makes death look like a lot of fun"

This lack of development leaves audiences detached, struggling to invest in a character that remains enigmatic without purpose.Furthermore, Madam Web's role within the Marvel universe feels forced and inconsequential. Despite being positioned as a key figure, she often comes across as a mere plot device rather than a fully fleshed-out character with agency and depth. The narrative fails to explore her potential impact on the larger Marvel landscape, rendering her existence seemingly arbitrary.The character's visual representation also falls short of expectations. Madam Web's design lacks the creativity and distinctiveness that define iconic Marvel characters. Her costume and appearance feel generic, failing to leave a lasting visual impression that would make her stand out among the plethora of superheroes and villains within the Marvel universe.Narratively, Madam Web's involvement in various story arcs often feels like an afterthought. Writers struggle to integrate her seamlessly into overarching plots, leading to disjointed storytelling that detracts from the overall cohesion of the comic series. This lack of narrative integration leaves Madam Web feeling like a superfluous addition rather than a meaningful contribution to the Marvel mythos.Moreover, Madam Web's powers, centered around precognition, become a repetitive narrative device. The constant reliance on her ability to foresee events diminishes the element of surprise and suspense in the storytelling, making her appearances predictable and, ultimately, monotonous."," Sony dropped the ball again."

I don't even really know (but it's not horrible), the VFX in some scenes is really off, it's just.... a large product of ""whatever"" soup when it could've at least been a pretty decent broccoli cheddar pasta bowl.That all said, this could've been significantly worse.Like, yeah, I have criticisms.

However, my excitement quickly dissipated within the first few minutes of the film.""Madem"" fails to deliver anything remotely engaging or original. Instead, it feels like a mishmash of tired tropes and clich√©s stitched together with subpar acting and uninspired direction.One of the most glaring issues with ""Madem"" is its lack of character development. The protagonist is a cookie-cutter rendition of every revenge-seeking vigilante we've seen countless times before. There's nothing compelling or nuanced about her journey; she simply moves from one revenge set-piece to another without any real depth or motivation.Moreover, the supporting cast adds little to the narrative. Their performances are wooden at best, with dialogue so stilted it's almost painful to endure. It's as if the actors themselves couldn't muster any enthusiasm for the project, and it shows in every scene.Visually, ""Madem"" is equally unimpressive. The cinematography lacks imagination, opting for generic shots that do nothing to enhance the story or atmosphere. Even the action sequences, which should be the film's saving grace, feel choreographed and uninspired.Perhaps most disappointing is the wasted potential of the premise. A story centered around a female protagonist seeking revenge in a male-dominated underworld could have been a captivating exploration of power dynamics and gender politics. Instead, ""Madem"" reduces itself to mindless violence and gratuitous scenes that add nothing of substance to the narrative.In conclusion, ""Madem"" is a forgettable addition to the genre that offers nothing new or noteworthy. Its lack of originality, poor character development, and uninspired execution make it a film that's best avoided.

But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching.

Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad.

"131","Madame Web","hotrobinproductions","1/10","16 February 2024","Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark.

To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time."," A massive waste of time"

"134","Madame Web","olcare","1/10","16 February 2024","It's the worst movie and superhero adaptation I've watched in recent years. Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION. How can I not believe this money, I really can't believe it, it's nothing but disrespect to yourself, disrespect to the audience, nothing but an insult."," I am filled with hatred, it can't get any worse."
"135","Madame Web","Skruffbagg","1/10","20 February 2024","Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels."," So bad it's good, or so bad it's bad?

"136","Madame Web","sinscopefilms","3/10","15 February 2024","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clich√©d, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10."," I regret watching this film"

(Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"," An all-time disasterpiece"
"138","Madame Web","MiroslavKyuranov","4/10","14 February 2024","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago."," Fifty Shades Of Mess"
"139","Madame Web","movieman6-413-929510","2/10","17 February 2024","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series."," Writers produce messy, tired work without really knowing what to do with it."
"140","Madame Web","vengeance20","2/10","20 February 2024","Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10."," It's Bad."
"141","Madame Web","isaacsundaralingam","1/10","19 February 2024","Yea, this was garbage and that's saying plenty. It's actually adorable how little anyone cared about ""Madame Web"" - not just the audience, but the filmmakers and actors themselves. Written by the same people who wrote ""Morbius"", this movie is yet another reason to not let them anywhere near a writing software ever again.Not only was the movie unwatchable due to how lifeless it was, but it was also criminally boring. You're waiting for something to happen and you keep waiting right until the credits start to roll. Nothing about the movie was compelling, the plot was riddled with plot holes, the screenplay was lazy, the dialogues were dead and the acting was almost as if the actors were held captive and being forced to act as if everything was okay. It reeks of corporate greed and there isn't a single positive thing to say about this movie.We're only a month and half into the year and we already have a very strong contender for what might be the worst movie of the year, and it's not even close. Don't watch it, but if you do indeed decide to, I hope you lived a life well enough to have a crowded funeral."," And you thought Morbius was bad"
"142","Madame Web","darrelltill","1/10","15 February 2024","There is nothing good in this film. It's badly written - not just full of clich√©s but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like clich√© superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent."," Madame Pleb"
"143","Madame Web","alindsayal","1/10","16 February 2024","With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10."," One of the worst Comic Book Films Ever"
"144","Madame Web","vfphvnpp","2/10","14 February 2024","I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend."," Badly made, weird film"
"145","Madame Web","SnoopyStyle","6/10","18 March 2024","It's 2003. Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) and Ben Parker (Adam Scott) are NYFD paramedics. She's an orphan when 30 years earlier, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) killed her mother during an Amazon scientific expedition. They had gone to find a mysterious spider with great healing powers and a local legend of a people with outrageous superpowers. Back to 2003, Sims has not aged. He has spider superpowers and premonition of his own death years later. Using stolen tech, he finds the teenage versions of his three spider-powered assassins; Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Coraz√≥n (Isabela Merced), and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor).The popular criticism is that this is the worst movie of the year. Everybody is dunking on this and my expectations are pretty low coming into this. It's not the worst thing in the world. It's not even the worst thing coming from this branch of the spider team. It's passable with some big issues in writing, logic, and overall flow. Most importantly, I like Dakota Johnson. She's playing the reluctant hero. Now, the three girls are rather annoying at first. The movie solves this by showing the villain right away. I thought the girls would spend half the movie thinking that Webb had actually kidnapped them. That would truly be annoying. I get the standard bratty teen characters, but I don't have to like them. I would make a few changes. First, I would skip the 1973 opening. The audience could discover the story along with Cassandra and there could always be flashbacks. Second, the girls should join her on the trip to the Amazon. That would make more logical sense. She would want the girls close to her at all times and the final battle could take place in the jungle. That's also a great way for the girls to get their superpowers. This movie has plenty of writing problems and others, but I've seen much worst."," not the worst"
"146","Madame Web","r96sk","8/10","16 February 2024","Ouch, that average rating! I'm not going to lie though, I genuinely had a fun time watching 'Madame Web'... perhaps I should be keeping that fact quiet?I don't know what to say, I found it to be suitably entertaining. I'm sure there are plot holes aplenty (I noticed a few) and it probably makes zero sense/isn't a good adaptation compared to its source material or whatever but honesty... I don't care, it gave me enough enjoyment that I wasn't questioning anything about what I was watching.The cast are probably the key factors as to why I did enjoy this. I previously knew of Dakota Johnson but hadn't actually seen her in anything properly, I found her performance to be more than noteworthy and she spearheads the film strongly. The trio of Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor are positives too.Tahar Rahim's antagonist, meanwhile, is poorly written and portrayed, though I personally thought the actor did a good job. I have no complaints with anyone who appears onscreen to be honest. Away from them, the pacing and score are also standouts.In my recollection of viewing this, I truthfully haven't got any issues with it. If it wasn't for the slight bad murmurs that I did hear about pre-watch (though not much of it as I avoid as much as I can with movies) and the reaction on sites like this post-watch, I'd not be questioning my thoughts about this whatsoever.As I always say, to each their own.

"147","Madame Web","nizarsalim","7/10","27 February 2024","Madame Web is not as bad as people and critics say because it has a number of elements that deserve praise. The performance of Johnson, Sweeney, Merced, O'Connor, and Rahim, story, direction, screenplay, cinematography, and soundtrack, all deserve praise, even though they are not the best that can be seen in a superhero movie.Regarding the flaws, what I didn't like is the visual and sound effects, action scenes, which were not so many, some confusing story elements, and the lack of connection to the spidermen charactersIn general, I enjoyed Madame Web, even though it is not the best Marvel movie that can be seen these days. But at least, I see it better that Morbius. That is why when it comes to the score, I give Madame Web 7 out of 10."," Not as Bad as the Reviews Say About it"
"148","Madame Web","fung0","8/10","17 March 2024","There's some sort of madness that sweeps over movie critics and movie fans every so often. Some pundit, reviewer, influencer or other nitwit sounds off about how feeble, terrible, horribly BAD a movie is (or is *going* to be - these opinions often predate any viewing of the actual movie). And then the herd instinct takes over and generates a tsunami of contempt.Case in point, Madame Web - a truly ridiculous number of one-star reviews, completely unjustified by the actual experience of watching the movie.The surprising truth is that this is actually quite a decent little movie. It's no work of genius, but it is a workmanlike, efficient, competent piece of entertainment. Not only is it not ""the worst,"" it is far more entertaining than a whole host of bloated, forgettable superhero flicks of the past few years.Start with the characters. We have an interesting heroine, Cassandra Webb, nicely embodied by Dakota Johnson. She's likeable, believable and suitably challenged by events she doesn't really understand. I can't speak to Johnson's acting range, not having seen her in anything else, but she seems to fit this particular part perfectly.Most of the movie has to do with Cassandra's attempts to protect three teen-age girls. All three of them are presented as distinct personalities, and are elevated beyond mere stereotypes by earnest and appealing performances by the trio of actresses. I not only believed them, I was happy to spend time with them.Then there's the story. It's nothing we haven't seen before, but it's done well. The origin of Cassandra's odd powers is novel, and revealed in stages that keep us guessing. Refreshingly, Cassandra needs to hold a super-villain at bay without actually knowing there's such a thing as a super-hero movie - or that she's in one.Better yet, Cassandra's super-talent is inherently unpredictable, in an interesting way. It reminded me of the excellent Nicolas Cage film Next, in which he has the ability to see the future - two minutes at a time. The storyline of Madame Web is somewhat formulaic, to be sure - but it's a good formula, and well-executed. I never felt my intelligence was being insulted, and I certainly never felt bored.The inevitable computer effects are used sparingly. Action is kept on a human scale - far more engrossing than watching CG heroes destroying planets with their pinky fingers.I tip-toed into Madame Web with dire forebodings of a wasted evening. Two hours later I found myself wishing the movie was longer - and wondering what ghastly childhood traumas must have prompted the vast torrents of vitriol that have been aimed at it.Sure, Madame Web isn't a breakthrough of any kind. But it's a completely professional piece of work - a solid two hours' escape from the troubles of the real world. Maybe it doesn't follow the comics - I don't know, and couldn't possibly care less. Maybe there were some nasty studio conflicts during production - again, not my concern. The end result was good. I had fun. Unless you come in solidly determined to hate, I can't see why you wouldn't have fun too.Rating: 8 out of 10. To me, 7 indicates a movie that succeeds in its aims - that entertains and does nothing conspicuously off-putting, worth seeing for anyone who likes the genre. However, I felt compelled to add an extra mercy star to offset the numerous undeservedly low ratings."," In what crazy universe is this ""the worst movie of all time""??"
"149","Madame Web","rgkarim","5/10","15 February 2024","LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying d√©j√† vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are clich√©, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it.

"152","Ghostbusters","talexander12599","7/10","1 August 2015","Ghostbusters is a movie from 1984 starring Bill Murray (Groundhog Day, Lost in Translation, Moonrise Kingdom), Dan Aykroyd (The Blues Brothers, Ghostbusters Franchise, Trading Places), Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day, Analyze This, Ghostbusters Franchise) and Sigourney Weaver (Alien Franchise Avatar). It was written Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis (Honey I Shrunk the Kids, Spaceballs, Strange Brew) and is directed by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters Franchise, Up in the Air, No Strings Attached).Ghostbusters follows three scientists: Peter (Bill Murray), Ray (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon (Harold Ramis) as they start their own ghost catching business and their biggest job yet is in a musician named Dana's (Sigourney Weaver) own refrigerator. This hilarious movie is carried by is fun characters brought to life by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. They are each very different and very funny in their own ways. Murray plays a classic, sarcastic Bill Murray character, Aykroyd plays a nervous quiet man who is really excited to be living out his dream and Ramis plays a very smart, nerdy, and odd man. They ad-lib most of their lines which makes this all even better.I actually think the success of Ghostbusters led to all of this ghost hunter reality show crap we see on TV today. This was the first movie to really have the idea of ghost hunting itself which means it is very original and started a ghost craze and a (not so good) sequel.Most of the effects in this movie do look quite dated while films like Blade Runner (which came out two years earlier) do not. But all of this adds to the fun of this incredibly fun, hilarious movie from the 80's."," Who you gonna call?"

This film was nearly perfect, but sadly still not made for everyone. It's an important film, as well as very entertaining. It starts in New York City. A gritty, hard movie about gritty hard people, but it's also intelligent. Sounds corny? It's meant to be goofy. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect.

Subtlety, wit, good performances and a smart and crisp story. Three out-of-work, oddball scientists found a company that gets rid of ghosts from haunted places. They encounter myriad spirits and are put to test when they have to face the mother-of-all-ghosts in a riveting climax.The movie is just a cascade of one comedic situation after another and at the same time, we are also interested in the big picture. Bill Murray is one of the ghostbusters and his character is unusual for a scientist; he appears bored throughout the movie, when he is chasing ghosts or courting the Sigourney Weaver character. Weaver herself is brilliant as both the cynic and the temptress, before and after she is possessed respectively. All the supporting characters are memorable. They all have their own weird personalities. Heck, even the ghosts, big or small, cute or fierce, have personalities.

However, when the grant is taken away he soon finds himself out on the street with his colleagues looking for a way to survive. As luck would have it, when a real apparition is reported to be in a nearby library he soon becomes convinced and along with his colleagues, ""Dr. Raymond Stantz"" (Dan Aykroid) and ""Dr. Egon Spengler"" (Harold Ramis) sets up a team known as ""Ghostbusters"" to make some money. What he doesn't know is that a supernatural event is about to happen which will elevate his status beyond anything he ever anticipated. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very popular film when it first came out and even though it has since lost some of its initial appeal still remains a solid comedy today. I especially liked the performance of Sigourney Weaver (as ""Dana Barrett"") who played her role quite well. In any case, this is one of those movies which some viewers looking for a decent comedy might want to give a try and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."," I Ain't 'Fraid of No Ghost"

I saw this film multiple times in my childhood and recently caught it again at a special event showing at my local theater.

Running wild in the psychology department, Venkman doesn't take his job serious but his fellow professors Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis).

The thing is too, that I usually bypass most popular culture from the 80's (the decade that taste forgot), for instance I've never watched ""Ghost"", ""Dirty Dancing"", ""Top Gun"" or ""E.T."" and won't be rushing to in the near future, there are far too many earlier movies I've still to see. But hey, I really enjoyed this unusual mix of frat comedy and supernatural / science fiction thrills.I liked the three amigo scientists right away, the womanising Bill Murray, earnest Dan Ayckroyd and professorial Ivan Reitman. Sigourney Weaver adds the sexiness (eventually) and Rick Moranis outdoes the three busters in geekiness as Weaver's lovelorn neighbour. The natural landscape of New York is effectively blended in, the special effects are fine for their day and the script delivers excitement and humour in equal measure.Not every idea from the Saturday Night Live team hit the jackpot but this one certainly deserved to, helped by an offbeat idea with broad appeal, a good script and a nice story arc which not only delivers a big finish but also sees Murray get the girl.Call again!"," Good spirits"

"162","Ghostbusters","Cineanalyst","7/10","30 September 2018","While the three pseudo-scientists of ""Ghostbusters"" occupy themselves professionally with the paranormal, their sexual desires likewise are abnormally characterized by paraphilic tendencies. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) takes joy in the sadistic torment of other men, which ordinarily is limited to mere sardonic remarks and poking fun at supposedly less masculine men for their nasal congestion, short height, or what have you, but at its most violent also manifests in his electric-shocking of a male test subject in an experiment of which the validity Venkman jeopardizes in the pursuit of his perverse pleasures. Perhaps, ashamed of his own desires, he also makes excessive displays of his supposed heterosexuality, including flirting with the female test subject and later aggressively, if clownishly, making passes at Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver).Meanwhile, Ray's (Dan Aykroyd) paraphilia extends to a complete displacement of other people as the source of sexual attraction; instead, his spectrophilia appears as a dream where a female ghost signifies further sexual displacement by disappearing before performing fellatio on him. Later, his fantasizing of another non-human humanoid object is made real in the form of the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, a figure from his childhood, which is the time when all of those Freudian quacks like to locate the origins of sexual feelings. And, of course, there's the obviously-symbolic pole he's so enthusiastic about in their repurposing of an old fire station. Egon, on the other hand, seems to be entirely consumed in his pseudo-scientific pursuits, even seeming to not react in the least to the advances of the Ghostbusters' receptionist Janine (Annie Potts). Rather than being asexual, his interests are displaced in the phallic guns or wands of the Ghostbusters' ""proton packs,"" which they employ to ejaculate energy streams, trapping gooey ectoplasmic matter into a shared box. Perhaps, like Peter, Egon also fears his homoerotic tendencies, though, and insists that the men avoid crossing streams.But, of course, crossing their streams is what the entire male-bonding narrative is building up to. Being the 1980s, this includes the homophobic government, in the form of the ""dick-less"" EPA man, butting in, protesting the Ghostbusters' pollution of ejaculating streams and captured slime and even the propagandic effect their activities have upon society. This backfires, however, unleashing the latent desires the Ghostbusters themselves feared and contained in the ""closet""--the unleashing of them taking the form of flamboyant streams of light and sparkling stars in a rainbow of colors spreading throughout the city. The Catholic mayor's kissing of the Archbishop's ring and turning to him for approval/guidance also plays into the unleashing of the Ghostbusters' phallic powers, but I'm not going to look into that plot point any deeper than that. Now, freed from the closet, so to speak, and after a stint in jail, the Ghostbusters' antagonist takes the form of Old-Testament Biblical proportions in the form of a heterosexually-coded coupling of ghosts: the ""Keymaster"" (read ""male"") and the ""Gatekeeper"" (read ""female""). And reigning supreme is the god Gozer, who takes the shape of the Ghostbusters' gendered ""other,"" a woman. The men's triumph is in defeating this ghastly heterosexual and female gendered possession of their city.After the men cross streams, resulting in the explosion of white goop from Ray's latent childhood desires pouring over them, the three doctors quickly resort to their prior postures of homoerotic denial: Peter to the rescue of the damsel-in-distress Dana, and Egon and Ray to the safer confines of the short and daft male subject Louis (Rick Moranis), for whom Egon quickly remarks on his desire to perform pseudo-scientific tests upon. The fourth Ghostbuster, Winston (Ernie Hudson), however, the only normal man among them and who, presumably, has a healthy sexual attitude, proclaims with pride, while covered in goo, ""I love this town!""This makes me rethink what may be underlying the outcry over the casting of women in the 2016 ""Ghostbusters"" reboot, of what is one of the most, let's say, male-centric of classic comedies. Or... ""Ghostbusters"" is just a silly comedy with the best zingers coming from Bill Murray, a catchy soundtrack and a production design and dated visual effects that remain charming."," Phallic Phantasms"
"163","Ghostbusters","lasttimeisaw","7/10","9 September 2014","My belated visit to the 80s classic ultra-popular American supernatural comedy directed by Ivan Reitman, indisputably his most successful directorial work to date, the Hollywood veteran is now in the inevitable course of being eclipsed by his son Jason Reitman, who is already a two-times Oscar-nominated director (JUNO 2007, 8/10 and UP IN THE AIR 2009, 7/10). The film stars Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis as a trio of nerdy parapsychologists in New York, after being dismissed by the university, they initiate a service knows as Ghostbusters to deal with the more and more frequent paranormal activities in the city, things then trace back to Gozer, a Sumerian amorphous god of destruction, who is going to wreck havoc on the city, with the aids of its two servants, Zuul the Gatekeeper and Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster, two ferocious dog- shaped demigods.The core trio (later joined by Ernie Hudson as the fourth member to appear politically corrected) predates the current trend of brain-is-the-new-sexy, Peter Venkman (Murray) more or less is a philanderer and particularly disarming in his aloof attitude to the gravitas of their cause. Raymond Stantz (Aykroyd) has a more guileless mindset, a man-boy hybrid will lovably bring about a beast of a giant marshmallow man. Egon Spengler (the late Ramis) is the geek among geeks, a stern-looking scientists with fully-functional apparatus to bust some ghosts. Peter's new love interest is Dana (Weaver), their first client soon to be possessed by Zuul, so is her neighbor Louis Tully (Moranis), as the receptacle of the Keymaster. The special effects are very much 1980s, but they are also the brainchild of a genuinely extraordinary creation, massively uproarious in its pokerface seriousness (not to mention its contagious theme song by Ray Parker Jr. The wacky script written by Aykroyd and Hamis is the mainstay of its distinctiveness, Murray's iconic personification of his on-screen image is droll to watch, Weaver is beguilingly titillating after the possession and Moranis's loquacious improvisation slightly overstays its welcome, but appropriately dovetails itself into the demigod.Very rarely a comedy can blend well with its spectral fodder and family-friendly closeness, GHOSTBUSTERS is far from being a perfectly executed masterpiece, or a cutting-edge cinematic pioneer, but its common-or-garden stance effectively boosts the ""everyone can be a hero"" message, no wonder it has been an enormous crowd-pleaser and bred into a beloved franchise since the inception. I may skip its 1989 sequel but a long-delayed third installment doesn't seem to a bad idea at all, or the latest rumor is the BRIDESMAIDS (2011, 7/10) helmer Paul Feig is eying for an all-female reboot, it sounds much more enticing, Bill Murray even gives his own suggestion of the casting, see here"," an 80s classic fun-raiser"

Just an old fashioned time when we had fun looking at ectoplasm and enjoying the heroes' adventures when they tried to solve the problem. It was comedy with special effects, and ""Ghostbusters"" works for the most part.Yes, the effects are a bit cheesy. Maybe they're meant to be that way, and it's got an innocent feel to it. The ultimate monster is a marshmallow man that will destroy civilization as we know it. One's worst fate is to be slimed or turned into a dog, and it's a lot of fun most of the time, but it could have used more Bill Murray and more editing to give us a better experience.Most of the joy is seeing all that talent in the screen. Bill Murray's dry approach is just a delight. Everything from his one-liners, his gestures, and his exchanges with Sigourney Weaver who is truly a sport while sparring with him, growing to like him as the film progresses, and Rick Moranis plays his nerdy part so well, it's hard not to start laughing every time he jumps in the scene. Everyone else does well, but the three standouts are the ones mentioned before.NYC is threatened by a surge in supernatural activity, and soon references such as the key master are thrown around.

The premise of a group of ghost hunters could've crashed and burned instantly, but the quirky dialog and dead pan acting of Bill Murray (the main Ghost Buster) really saved the day.
Unfortunately, the only thing that doesn't stand up are the special effects. Even by 1984's standards, Ghost Busters falls way short with its cheap looking effects. What leaves me scratching my head is that Richard Edlund (Star Wars) was behind the SFX and was even (gasp!) nominated for an Academy Award!!! ""Poltergeist"", which came 2 years earlier has SFX that for the most part, stand out quite well even today.Still, Ghost Busters is still a fun, if slightly dated, classic to watch."," Still Fun To Watch"
"170","Ghostbusters","oneguyrambling","7/10","6 November 2010","Ghostbusters is widely acknowledged as one of the defining movies of the 1980s. Everyone seems to remember it fondly and you still hear ""Don't cross the streams"" and ""I am the Keymaster"" randomly quoted from time to time.Now I'm not here to burst any bubbles, I have nothing but positive thoughts whenever the movie is mentioned, but watching the 25th Anniversary edition recently I began to second guess its standing.Immediately after watching the film again the other night I thought that it is not realistic to call Ghostbusters one of the ""all time"" classics. Sure it is a good movie, charming and at times amusing, but it is not in the same league as other 80s flicks.Then a funny thing happened, two days passed and I allowed my memory to elevate Ghostbusters back up the pecking order¬Ö then I re-read my notes. Therefore I think Ghostbusters is perhaps a better concept than film, and I'm not knocking those that love this film and stand up for it, I just don't see it in the same light as say ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or even ""Stripes"", let alone ""Die Hard"" or ""Aliens"".Perhaps it was more your circumstances, I'm positive that movies I saw in my teens and early 20s are remembered more favourably simply because they were great times period in my life (not that now is so horrible), and I am now more analytical (unfortunately) and unforgiving when I am watching a film for the first time.Anyway Ghostbusters. Not a bad film in any respect, just not as good as some think.The film of course is about three guys who for no known reason start a paranormal investigation company after having their research grant summarily dragged. The three are Peter (Bill Murray), Ray (Dan Ackroyd) and Egon (Harold Ramis), Egon is the nerdy genius, Ray the ideas man and driving force behind the business and Peter just tags along for something to do and to get girls.As always Bill Murray is also the main reason to watch the film, and he provides most of the laughs throughout, including some that result from seemingly ad-libbed remarks after another character speaks.Their first mission is successful yet destructive, and luckily they find they have entered into a growth market, as paranormal activity increases in New York dramatically shortly after they commence operations. Due to the escalation in demand they hire a new ""Buster"" Winston, who doesn't do much in the film but obviously balanced out the poster.Their first client is Sigourney Weaver as Dana, who has a demonic possession in her fridge, (don't we all?), she happens to live in an apartment building that is a conduit for all that is evil in New York, and she wondered why the rent was so cheap? She is taken and possessed, as is her neighbour Lewis (Rick Moranis), and they begin a hunt for each other referring to themselves as the Gatekeeper and the Keymaster respectively.As there must be conflict in any movie the Environmental Protection Agency shuts down Ghostbusters operations and in doing so inadvertently release all their captured ghosties, increasing the very need for their existence, which doesn't help as they are in jail.This leads to the reason why I think the film is remembered in such a good light, once the boys are in jail and the ghosts cut loose New York cries out for their assistance, so the finale is not simply four guys in overalls running around with weird backpacks, but that plus a crowd of vocally supportive New Yorkers egging them on.At times it is almost like a sporting contest how the crowd interaction actually seems to elevate the importance of the Ghostbuster's actions, and it definitely gives the latter scenes a bit more buzz.Ultimately Ghostbusters is a fun film, though lightweight harmless and largely disposable. I would consider it a good rental every few years so that you might throw it in and shut your brain off for 90 minutes, but I can't see why people obsess over it.Final Rating ‚Äì 6.5 / 10. We all know the plot now, and 90% of the laughs of the laughs are from Bill Murray, but that could be said about all his films.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"," A defining film of the 80s - but hasn't aged that well."

Peter ""volunteers"" to help her.Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) then joins the team. In the course of their investigation Ray discovers that Dana's apartment building was constructed by and evil force known ""Gogen"" and that the spirits contained within are planning a comeback. Dana and Louis become possessed by the spirits to become the Gatekeeper and Key master respectively. Peter is mesmerized by Dana in her possessed state.The four Ghostbusters then lock and load and confront the evil Gogen who then thrusts the Marshmallow Man upon humanity and....................................The performances of the principals lift this film above the level of a Saturday Morning cartoon. It's hard though to take Bill Murray's character seriously as scientist. His constant smirk hardly indicates serious intent. Aykroyd and Ramis play their roles more to the point. Annie Potts almost steals the film as the brash secretary. And Sigourney Weaver never looked more sexy than she does as the possessed Dana. Rick Moranis is quite funny as the nerdy neighbor who continuously keeps locking himself out of his apartment. And poor Ernie Hudson. He hardly has anything of note to do after arriving late in the story.Followed by ""Ghostbusters II"" (1989) as we knew it would."," Slime Gentlemen Please!"
"173","Ghostbusters","filipemanuelneto","7/10","26 March 2016","In this film, the protagonists are four paranormal fanatics who decide to join forces and create a company specialized in removing ghosts of New Yorker's houses. The boss is Dr. Peter Venkman (played by Bill Murray), an parapsychologist little crazy and deeply sarcastic. He's assisted by Dr. Egon Spengler (embodied by Harold Ramis), the intellectual genius of the quartet, Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Winston Zeddmore (played by Ernie Hudson). In this film, they have to win Gozer, a demonic entity that will try to use Dana (Sigourney Weaver), a girl who Venkman tried to conquer, to achieve it's dark aim of destroying the world.We're facing, probably, one of the most iconic comedies of the eighties. Bill Murray, who could already consider himself an experienced comedy actor, reached an exceptional level, dominating this movie and toasting the audience with deeply ironic and irresistible laughing moments. The result was Murray's launch to stardom, as one of the best comedians of the eighties cinema. Another actor that was highlighted was Rick Moranis, who plays Mr. Tully, one of the funniest characters in this film thanks to Moranis enormous talent. The film has a number of very good special effects, probably the best of his time, a time when special effects knew how to be in a movie without dominating it. The soundtrack is also a very positive aspect of this movie, with the ""Ghostbuster's"" song topping the Billboard Hot 100. This song is still known to the general public presently.This film should be one of the comedies that more money earned over during the eighties. And it's not difficult to understand why: it's a movie for everyone and appeals to children the same way as the elderly. It's very curious that a film whose many critics said so bad manages to keeps it's popularity today, thirty years after being released."," An icon of the eighties still winning public today"

Before seeing this film, I only saw the god awful 2016 remake, Afterlife & Frozen Empire, the later 2 which were enjoyable & pretty good! Even though I'm a particular fan of this franchise, I still enjoyed the latter 2 films as well as this one!3 parapsychologists forced out of their university funding set up shop as a unique ghost removal service in New York City, attracting frightened yet skeptical customers!I found the film to be pretty decent! I mean, it's a little cheesy & the effects are a little fake looking, but, it's generally good & even the effects are good for their time! The story is good & straight forward & there's some funny humour added in here too along with some good action scenes!The actors do a good job here & knock it out the park with their roles & one liners! The film is well paced & has a runtime of 1 hour & 34 minutes (94 minutes), so it isn't too long & drawn out & as I said before, has some good pacing to go along with it!Overall, it's a good film! Yes, it's a little dated but it's generally a good sci-fi supernatural action flick with some pretty good effects for a film of the 1980's! Give this a watch & you'll sure enjoy it!7/10."," Decent Film!"
"175","Ghostbusters","FKDZ","7/10","23 March 2024","Ghostbusters, now without question this is a iconic movie deeply ingrained in almost everyone's head, if only for the iconic soundtrack. And as a movie, it's still entertaining to this day. But I guess I'm just late to the party, because I didn't really fall in love with it as much as I'd hoped.First off as far as the concept goes, the production design and all the stuff behind it it's fantastic. It's props, the world, all great. The casting just as good with a perfect set of characters and actors put in place to fulfill a nice spectrum of comedic moments with each character and their unique traits. And as far as funny, this movie has some chuckle moments for sure. But I'm nowhere near crying of laughter, all subjective though. What this movie mostly has is some smart writing, and doesn't rely on too many gags. Making it age fairly well.Directing, imo, visually nothing too spectacular, excluding VFX, which obviously show their age, especially the dogs, the beams still look great to this day though. But as for directing I don't find it paced all that well nor anything special. It doesn't get very creative even though the script has a lot of opportunity for it.As a sidenote, funnily enough going into this movie I was expecting all these scenes where they build/design their car or equipment, but to my surprise there's none of that. It's just made off screen and that's that.Acting, mostly great, Murray shines as the headliner in a now familiar type of role and character, everyone else does their role as well but no-one is giving top of their career performances here.Music, the main soundtrack, obviously great. Everything else around it, pretty average.Not much else to say really. I didn't do all too much for me sadly."," Ghostbusters"

This film expertly balances itself right between the horror genre and the comedy genre. The chemistry of the main three characters is undeniable, and when you throw in interesting side characters (such as Rick Moranis as Louis Tully), every scene is a delight to watch.

"177","Ghostbusters","ivo-cobra8","10/10","25 December 2015","This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CGI.Ghostbusters (1984) is the best classic original spectacular supernatural masterpiece from Ivan Reitman! One of if not the greatest films ever! My favorite film of all time! ""Ghostbusters"" is the film that made me become a fan ever since I was young! It had an awesome cast, cool special effects, hilarious dialogue and a kick-ass soundtrack! The film that can be watched over and over again! I grew up watching Ghostbusters on TV and the animated TV series The Real Ghostbusters (1986 - 1991). Ghostbusters II (1989) actually introduced me in to Ghostbusters. I loved them so much that I even said to my mom, when I grown up I will be a Ghostbuster! It was my fantasy. Watching it yesterday and I still love it. I love this flick to death! I still can't believe it how the world changed and how in the 80's the world was better than today! I always have enjoyed the sequel much better than as a child, it was my first movie but now as an adult, I love and enjoy the original movie to death! It is the only movie I own on Blu-ray disc and I still love it. This is an amazing movie! Funny, smart, well written and directed. It features an outstanding performance from Bill Murray, great showings by Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis and one of the last documented instances of Dan Aykroyd being funny on film (he was blown by a ghost!). In fact, the film gets a great performances from nearly everyone who appears in it- from Annie Potts, to the guy who played Lenny the Mayor, to the handsome cab driver who calls Rick Moranis an asshole. In addition, they had one of the best ""a-hole"" guys ever to appear on film, as the film's bad guy- I'm talking of course of the grossly under-rated William Atherton- who played the EPA guy, ""Dickless"". Atherton, of course went on to play memorable a-holes in Real Genius and of course he was the annoying reporter in Die Hard (1988) but here in Ghostbusters, you really see a solid performance by maybe the best guy to play an a-hole in films in the 80's. Next Year the reboot is coming out as Paul Feig's Ghostsnuters, Ghostbitches or Ghostflufers./: Ghostbusters (2016) with women now as a Ghostbusters! Why rebooting this awesome supernatural spectacular comedy flick? I know the sequel failed and Bill Murray did not want anything to do with it. But that doesn't mean that they shouldn't have made Ghostbusters III in the 90's, they should have! Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis tried so hard to convince Bill Murray to do it for the third sequel and they couldn't convinced him. They are going to ruin the Original movie! I don't want to see Ghostbusters with a female leads. Come on? The girls are not the Ghostbusters, they are three man a scientists and a one civilian. The Ghostbusters are the only one Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Bill Murray. They were always be the Ghostbusters that will be the case. No one else will be! No one else will replace them! This is like A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) that come out the same year as the Ghostbusters did, they remake it and that remake failed!! It was awful boring! Why remaking or rebooting my classic horror comedy's that I Love?! Ghostbusters (1984) are unique, classic 80's masterpiece! These were the best times for movies ever!!! One of my favorite soundtracks and movie of all time!They just don't make them like this anymore. This is comedic writing and performance at its peak... with quotes that everyone knows and enjoys. From ""This reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head"" to ""Symmetrical book stacking. Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947"" to ""Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you! "" this is a CLASSIC movie! Ghostbusters is a true classic comedy that stands the test of time. The film is funny, awesome and entertaining. It has a lot of laughs. I love the soundtrack Ghostbusters Written and Performed by Ray Parker Jr. I think he did made a great soundtrack in the 80's. If there's something strange in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!!!! A film that can be watched with the various youngest to the very oldest of the family. Wonderful collection of characters. A film that is treasured by just about everyone that watches it. I miss movies from the 80's and this film felt so realistic.

"178","Ghostbusters","AlsExGal","10/10","29 June 2018","Ghostbusters was so great because it took the science fiction and fantasy part seriously (considering how Dan Aykroyd IRL is a strong believer in the paranormal this makes sense), so the humor was almost entirely from dialogue and the performance of the cast. It takes the simple concept of ""people who start a ghost catching business"" and adds things like multidimensional gods and giant killer corporate mascots. These are things you wouldn't expect from a comedy movie at the time. Apparently, Aykroyd's original draft of the story was almost entirely sci-fi action with little humor.The resulting story was dead serious, and rather terrifying. A woman becoming possessed by a demon just because of where her apartment is? Being transformed into a monster, then into stone while she was unwillingly in service to a dark god? That is scary, not funny. What MADE the movie funny was how the actors responded to the situation. They were just like normal people, put in an abnormal situation, and responded in line with their own personal character, which was mainly to crack jokes so they could handle the fear. It was just four guys, out of their depth, going in with a grin because backing down wasn't an option for them.Bill Murray just shows outstanding comedic timing in this one. He had me from the opening scene where he is shocking a male subject in an experiment while simultaneously trying to ""get the girl"" by convincing her she is psychic.What was 80s about it? Well, the triumph of the private sector over academeia - ""I've worked in the private sector, they expect results"", and the EPA contributing to the end of the world. Everybody could forget about Watergate, recessions, and nuclear war, and just laugh at the movies for a change. If you've never seen it I recommend it . The comedy is timeless."," Just a perfect piece of comedic timing and so 80s"

"180","Ghostbusters","DavidSim240183","10/10","5 December 2003","This was one of the first films I grew up with as a child. I remember watching Ghostbusters on video, and then I would rewind it and watch it all over again. I must have seen this film at least 100 times, and I'm happy to say it is still enjoyable to me even today.The basic premise of the film is rather daft, but because of such a great cast, Ghostbusters rises far above what might have been a completely idiotic film, and instead becomes a comedy classic.For anyone who hasn't seen Ghostbusters (if such a thing is possible), it is about three parapsychology professors Dr Peter Venkman (the wonderful Bill Murray), Dr Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) who are booted out of Columbia University because of their sloppy research methods.Now faced with unemployment, our trio decide to go into business for themselves. They set up the first 'paranormal, investigations and eliminations' business ever to grace New York City. In short, they are the Ghostbusters, our first, last (and only) line of defence against the paranormal world.Their first customer comes in the shapely form of Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), who has just had a nasty encounter with her fridge! It turns out to be something much more than she ever could have imagined, as she is possessed by something called Zuul, and is now preparing for the coming of Gozer, the demi-god.The Ghostbusters are now suddenly faced with an army of ghosts, an officious EPA inspector, and a possible apocalypse. These are all the plot threads neatly woven into the story, right up to the hilarious ending with Mr Stay Puft, the Marshmallow Man. (I kid you not).Directed by Ivan Reitman, and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, they have truly created a masterpiece. Bill Murray is perfectly cast as Venkman, His typical deadpan routine and laid-back manner is a perfect foil when faced with such other-worldly things. He gets all the best lines, and his delivery is spot-on. For example, when Dana is telling them what she saw in her fridge:""Generally you don't see that kind of behaviour in a major appliance"".Dan Aykroyd is good as 'the heart of the Ghostbusters', a well-intentioned man who has a tendency to cause problems for the group, (after all he does think up Mr Stay Puft. He co-wrote a well thought out, witty script.Harold Ramis manages to be funny in a way I can't properly explain. Some of the faces he pulls when in conjunction with the dialogue of the other cast members are hilarious. He is funny in a serious sort of way, if that means anything. He is the brains of the group, which means he is the only one who really knows what the hell is going on. He has shown a dab hand at directing in recent years, and I'm sure he came up with a lot of good ideas for this film. The best film he directed was Groundhog Day, pairing him up once again with Bill Murray.Sigourney Weaver gives a solid performance, and Ghostbusters is one of the first films that launched her on the road to stardom after Alien. She's certainly not out to play the damsel in distress, and carries herself strongly enough almost as she did as Ellen Ripley. She is certainly one of the first actresses to provide a role-model for other women as strong, female characters.The other characters have their moments too. Rick Moranis is not really that memorable as Louis Tully, but when possessed as the Key Master, he is quite funny. (Especially the scene where he gives the wagon driver the evil eye). Annie Potts is great as Janine Melnitz, their acerbic secretary. Like Murray, she is quite deadpan in her delivery too: (""I've quit better jobs than this"").Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore only comes into the film about halfway, and he always seems like an outsider when compared to the other Ghostbusters. However, he has a good chemistry with Aykroyd. The scene where they're talking about the end of the world is good, and its just a shame they weren't partnered up together more often.Some of the special effects have dated a little, for example, the Devil Dogs look a bit fake now. But some of the other special effects are still pretty good, like their proton packs, Slimer, and Mr Stay Puft is a magical marvel of special effects work. I understand some of the effects coordinators were the same people who did Raiders of the Lost Ark. That must have been the scene where the Nazis opened the Ark.Where the quality of the effects may have diminished a little, the film more then makes up for it in comedy. Some of the gags are quite subtle, written on a personal level that only the Ghostbusters could understand. With excellent lines from Murray, you can't complain, such as:""Why worry? Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back"".The ending is suitably daft, but doesn't cheapen the story in any way. All the actors have a terrific chemistry, and they obviously enjoyed making this film. They have all met before on shows like Saturday Night Live, where they learnt to understand each others abilities and compliment each other to come across as funny as possible. This film really enhanced their careers. The theme song may seem a bit cheesy to some people, but I like it. Sometimes I find myself humming it without realising.Definitely Ivan Reitman's best film, and (with the exception of Evolution) its just a shame he can't make films like this more often. It's a pity the sequel didn't live up to the excellence that was Ghostbusters."," Who ya gonna call?"

The dialogue is about as good as it can possibly be, but i felt that some of the deleted scenes should have been left in, most notable the fort scene. It spawned countless toys, 2 cartoon series, and left an entire generation of children born in the mid/late 80s (including yours truly) thinking they were their favorite ghostbusters and used the various kid-sized toys to catch imaginary ghost.

"182","Ghostbusters","Leofwine_draca","10/10","14 December 2012","GHOSTBUSTERS was one of my favourite films as a kid; I first saw it when I was about 5, and it scared the hell out of me (that librarian ghost - jeez!). My old VHS tape was worn through by the time I grew up and forgot about it. Now, years later, I decided to give it another spin and discover whether it was one of those films that holds up even when you're an adult...The answer is a resounding YES! GHOSTBUSTERS is still a great movie, a thoroughly entertaining classic for all ages. It's an out-and-out comedy featuring my favourite performance from a beautifully deadpan Bill Murray, who's perfectly supposed by Dan Ackroyd (who makes a great butt for the jokes), Harold Ramis (as the straight guy), Ernie Hudson (underrated), Sigourney Weaver (a delightful role reversal from Ellen Ripley) and little Rick Moranis, who's always hilarious.Although the film was made nearly 30 years ago, it hasn't dated in the slightest and the detectives vs. spooks storyline still holds up really well. I just can't get over how well made it is, with scenes that should be ridiculous (such as the climax) just totally gathering you up and immersing you in the experience. I love the Lovecraftian undertones, and the way the special effects are still much, much better than most of the CGI in modern movies. Those stop motion dog-creatures, absolutely fantastic, even now.Okay, so the sequel wasn't so great, but I'm a firm believer in the fact that no matter how many bad sequels or remakes, you can never spoil the entertainment value of a classic movie. And GHOSTBUSTERS is exactly that: a classic for all ages, a genuine family movie that never panders to a young audience and remains timeless because of it."," Childhood favourite and all-time classic"

"187","Ghostbusters","williampsamuel","10/10","7 December 2014","What a movie! What an original, goofy, side-splitting movie! Ghostbusters is one of those projects were everything just came together. Somebody had an idea, somebody else believed in it, all the right people got involved, and everything just flowed, producing an instant classic and a landmark of popular culture. From one idea that Dan Akroyd worked on in his spare time came on of mid eighties' best pictures, and perhaps the best horror-comedy since the days of Abbot and Costello.That idea of course, is 'What if there really were ghosts? And what if there were people who made a living catching them?' And the screenplay has a lot of fun with that idea, treating it like real life, down to advertising blitz and regulatory headaches. Yet at the same time it embraces the more fantastic aspects of the story, playing up hauntings, possessions, and the apocalypse to great comedic effect. There's a real blending of the supernatural and the mundane that you don't see a lot, certainly not with such hilarious results.Equally important is the superb casting. Every actor and actress is perfect for his/her role, which is not surprising considering that some of the roles were written for them. Akroyd, as the co-writer, created for himself a role that plays wonderfully to his natural talents. In real life, he's a smart, earnest, kind off nerdy guy, so naturally it follows that he should be an overly-excitable, somewhat gullible nerd who pours himself into his work. Harold Ramis is brilliant as Egon, the straight faced dry intellectual, and Ernie Hudson brings a real down to earth likability to Winston. Sigourney Weaver shows that she definitely has what it takes to play comedies; I have no idea how she managed to keep from cracking up during the 'possessed' scenes.But it's Bill Murray who really steals the show. One if Murray's greatest strengths as an actor is his shiftiness, his blatant insincerity, and as a result he's at his best when playing the schemer, the con man. And Peter Venkman is just such a man. He's a fraud, a charlatan who makes his living studying things he doesn't even believe in- and a shameless womanizer to boot. His chemistry with Weaver is priceless, and throughout he maintains the comedic balancing act that he does so well; never flat or deadpan, but never quite over the top. It's really his character driving this whole enterprise, even if he has no idea what he's doing.There are some good action sequences here, and a handful of truly scary parts, like the now-famous librarian. I especially love the ending, with what is surely the funniest giant monster ever created- nice going, Ray. The special effects are generally pretty good for 1985, and even when they aren't it only adds to the movie's goofy feel.Ghostbusters is also one the most quotable pictures since Monty Python and the Holy Grail. There are plenty of instantly recognizable one-liners, like ""He slimed me"" and ""Back off man, I'm a scientist,"" and some wonderfully tongue in cheek speeches, like the famous 'Twinkie speech,' or the one early on that begins with ""Call it fate, call it luck, call it karma."" It's hard to pick just one, but I would have to say that my favorite line is """"Man, the superintendent is gonna be pi**ed!"" And the dialog works even when being 100% serious. The conversation between Ray and Winston about the book of Revelation is a minor masterpiece in its own right.What else is there to say about this movie? It's got a wonderful score by Elmer Bernstein, and a killer theme song by Ray Parker Junior that actually went to number one on the singles charts. There are gorgeous views of New York City and a double serving of Big Apple attitude. Any way you look at it, this is a great production with everything done right from beginning to end.

They both have a wonderful deadpan manner, especially in a library scene very early on in the film.Dan Akyroyd is the naive mistake maker Ray Stanz, as his thoughts bring on the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, and Ernie Hudson rounds out the cast as Winston Zedmore, who is the last Ghostbuster to join up but is necessary.With Sigourney Weaver as Venkman's gorgeous love interest and Rick Moranis as her yuppie neighbor, this movie is a classic for anyone and definitely one of the best comedies EVER filmed!"," Hilarious!"

"191","Ghostbusters","andrewnmiller","10/10","14 October 2018","My first exposure to Ghostbusters happened when I was quite young and I do remember watching it a few times and rather enjoying it even if there were moments that scared the ever-loving crap out of me but as I got older, the film dropped out of my viewing radar until I decided to rewatch it last year and low and behold, it still holds up just as much as it did back in 1984. From it's ingenious mixture of horror and comedy to its perfect casting and catchy theme song, Ghostbusters easily stands head and shoulders above most of today's painfully unfunny comedies.The film starts with a ghost haunting an old library and freighting a librarian. Following this incident, three out-of-work parapsychologists named Peter Vankman, Raymond Stantz, and Egon Spengler, who have started their own business called Ghostbusters, are called in to investigate but are scared out of the library. Upon being fired from their jobs at a local university, the three move into an abandoned fire station and make it their base of operation. Meanwhile, a woman named Dana Barrett returns to her apartment and soon sees a carton of eggs cooking themselves on her countertop as an evil demonic spirit speaks the words ""Zuul"". Faced with the increased paranormal activity around New York City, the team hire another member named Winston Zeddmore but now they also must face an even greater threat then Dana is possessed by Zuul and prepares for the arrival of a Sumerian god known as Gozer and only the Ghostbusters can stop it.In light of the awful 2016 remake which felt more like an unintentional parody of a Ghostbusters movie, the original film still remains a high-water mark for comedies that deal with supernatural elements like Dogma, Young Frankenstein, and Beetlejuice. It's always been a hard nut to crack in terms of balancing the line between horror and comedy just right and while movies like Evil Dead II pulled this off perfectly, Ghostbusters remains the perfect cinematic model to use when it comes to approaching the area of supernatural comedy. Give how it was Dan Aykroyd who came up with the idea for a team of men traveling through time and different demotions hunting ghosts as well as writing the first outline for what the movie would later become, this idea is nothing short of interesting and original but when director Ivan Reitman got ahold of it, he told Dan to scale it back a notch and make it more grounded but nonetheless, it did provide a strong base for Reitman, Aykroyd, Harold Ramis as well as the rest of the cast to build upon and add in new ideas as they saw fit. Plus, the screenplay for the movie is a perfect example of how to do characters in a comedy without having them come across as painfully unfunny stereotypes or characters with no depth or personality. Over the course of the film, there are times where the character of Peter Vankman is doing things that any normal person would deem to be unappealing or downright offensive as shown in a scene where he deliberately gives a student a shock while carrying out a cognitive test. Now, does the scene make the viewer assume that Vankman is the kindest man on Earth? Not in the slightest. Does the moment make you believe that he is funny as all hell? Absolutely. Out of all of the characters in the movie, Vankman seems to be the one who grows the most as a person over the course of the story as he starts out as a flirting twit but once he meets Dana, he begins to change into a more bona fide and honorable character as well as having something worth fighting for ay the end of the film. As for the other Ghostbusters, they really don't get much in the way of development but with that being said, they really don't need any as they are flawless in their own right and have no reason to be developed. All four of the Ghostbusters are engaging, comical and serve the film's plot as they are needed. One thing this film does so much better than the remake was the handling of the character of Winston Zeddmore in that he isn't portrayed as a scientist but rather an average working-class guy who just needs a job which makes him a character anyone can relate to instead of a screaming African-American stereotype in the remake. Even the other side-characters like Janine Melnitz, Louis Tully, and Dana Barrett are great characters and they never feel like they overstay their welcome nor are they ever aggravating to the point of stupidity unlike some characters in recent comedy films. Something else that Ghostbusters does so it is making the lead characters the little guys who have to break the system and while the 2016 remake attempted to do the same thing, there it just felt automatically given to the 4 leads rather than have it be earned but in the '84 movie, that element of the story feels natural as the team really do feel like they are the underdogs as at first they all lose their jobs and are seen as deranged or hustlers by a large array of doubters. The '84 movie takes this idea even farther as by way of the character of Walter Peck: a pompous attorney for the EPA whose desire is to pull down the Ghostbusters at every turn and nearly achieves his goal. This idea not only provides the viewer a feeling that the team is doing battle against government officials and the order of things, it also gives the Ghostbusters some tangible blockades to conquer along with giving them the necessary character growth as a team. With the aid of Reitman and Ramis, Aykroyd grounded the movie's story in reality much in the same way Christopher Nolan would later do with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight so that not only do the Ghostbusters have to do battle with legislators, attorneys, and hotel supervisors while doing their job but also the world they inhabit looks real and lived-in rather than overly fanciful or dark and gritty. The romantic subplot between Peter and Dana is nicely handled as both characters have wonderful chemistry with each other and the romance never feels like it's just there for the sake of the plot not to mention Dana actually speaks like and acts like a real single woman in New York City which makes her character all the more likable and enduring and we understand why Peter is fond of her which is more than I can say for the overly-feminized and unlikable characters Paul Feig and Katie Dippold gave us in the remake. The romance between Vankman and Dana adds another grounded and adult aspect to the movie. Throughout the course of any action or action-comedy film, it's always a total blast to see the heroes having to something they shouldn't do in order to defeat the villain and save the day. Much like the air tanks in Jaws or Dr. Strange's plan in Avengers: Infinity War, the ex machine that will destroy Gozer is implied earlier in the movie. Not only is it essential to put your characters in a no-win scenario, but it's also a great innovation to have them win by shattering the rules. The crossing the streams idea isn't just a convenient resolution to the film's climax but it also adds to the movie's motifs of identity and anti- absolutism that run throughout the film. This is one of the many reasons why the original Ghostbusters is still seen as a beloved classic while the 2016 remake will likely continue to ridiculed and hated for years to come. Even though Dan Aykroyd required other people to help him get the story more grounded and less out there but simply put, there would have been no Ghostbusters if it wasn't for Dan and his zeal for the supernatural. The original movie never once demoralizes its ghostly aspects. Even those characters who are shown to be total cynics are soon convicted otherwise. The movie takes it's lore passionately and much of the movie's humor comes from how the characters respond to the eerie circumstances instead of the situations themselves. The Ghostbusters is in no way a camp movie but rather a supernatural comedy in the vain of what Tim Burton or Mel Brooks do with their films where the reaction is just as important as what we're seeing on screen. Even the arrival of the Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man at the end battle is more of a joke about Ray's childhood naivet√© being used against the team. The film was realized by a man who wasn't just fascinated by the paranormal but also had a great level of admiration for it as well. Regardless of whatever idea a movie has, no matter how outlandish or far-fetched, the more genuine it'll be if you put the effect into your film's screenplay and make that idea come alive, then the more convincing your movie will be to the audience and the more they'll respond to it. Unlike some modern-day blockbusters who feel like they need to be dull and grandiose in order to give the impression that they're somehow deep and thought-provoking films like Batman V. Superman and therefore lacking in any sense of fun or excitement, Ghostbusters is both a hilarious and entertaining film about the supernatural world that is able to work without having to talk down to it's audience. The action set pieces of the team catching Slimer in the hotel and the scene of them battling Gozer and the Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man are all perfectly executed to a high standard and looks incredibly real as well as a lot of fun to watch instead of the giant CGI eyesore action set piece that the 2016 movie gave us. As for the visual effects, they may look cheesy by today's standards but they still work in the movie's favor when working with the more comical style as well as being compatible with the overall story. There are even some genuinely frightening moments in keeping with the horror aspects of the film such as the stop-motion Terror Dogs or the scene of Dana being processed by Zuul and while the scares are few and far between, they still work wonderfully well. The soundtrack for Ghostbusters is composed by the great Elmer Bernstein and it's easily one of the best soundtracks for a comedy movie I've ever heard. The opening theme of the film"," A comedy that never seems to age."
"192","Ghostbusters","morro316","10/10","6 December 2003","Even now, nearly 20 years later this film is still as good as ever. Sure, the special FX world has moved on but they do not get in the way of a superb script and excellent direction from Ivan Reitman. How anyone can call this film 'boring' is totally beyond me.Bill Murray is absolutely superb in this - some of best work with the fantastic Groundhog Dog just beating his work in this. Some of his one liners are just hilarious and the cast's interaction with each other is a pleasure to watch (bar Ernie Hudson who just seems out of place and is the film's biggest weakness IMO). Sigourney Weaver does a decent job though her work as Ellen Ripley in the Alien series taxes herself a little more. Rick Moranis is fantastic though and its a shame he never seems to get more recognition than he does nowdays.If you've never seen Ghostbusters, then I implore you to go and grab it on DVD - its action packed, funny and even scary in some places. Just be wary of the Library scene in the early part of the film, scared the hell out of me when I saw it in my earlier years!!!9/10"," An absolute classic"
"193","Ghostbusters","Grig","10/10","7 October 2002","I knew a guy who once said that the only thing wrong with this film is that it wasn't the highest grossing movie of all time. In fact, there is nothing wrong with this film. The timing is perfect, all the actors are on the ball for the duration of the film, and the effects, for their time, are unparalleled. But it's not just that the film is well-made and technically proficient, it's also that it's obvious that a lot of time and energy went in to actually making it great. It's obvious from the opening at Columbia University that everyone involved with the production is having fun, and they want us to have just as much fun. Luckily, it works. I have never seen a film that is more fun, not to mention endlessly quotable, than ""Ghostbusters."" It's become a film that people go back to again and again for the simple aim of enjoying themselves. It's a film that makes people feel good and have a good time. Of course, this also extends to the film's life outside the cinema. Nine times out of ten, you can make a person born in the 70s or 80s crack up laughing simply by saying ""Important Safety Tip,"" or ""It would be bad,"" or ""If someone asks you if you're a god, you say YES!"" There are hundreds of other quotable lines from the film, but hopefully you get what I'm aiming at. The film is a joy to watch, and is one that you'll want to rewatch countless times."," You're Right. No human being would stack boxes like this. . ."
"194","Ghostbusters","lee_eisenberg","10/10","27 July 2005","When I was about 3 and 4, I used to watch ""The Real Ghostbusters"" on TV. When I was 7, I noticed that my parents had a video tape that said ""Ghostbusters"". I asked them if I could watch it, and they said yes.The first thing that threw me off was that it was black and white. Moreover, it was clearly not a cartoon. The lion statue outside the library probably confused me further. Then, after the woman saw the ghost in the library basement, I could only interpret the movie as scary. Literally every scene invoked fear in me, especially the monster in the refrigerator. By the time that it was over, I thought to myself ""I'm never watching that again."" Then, when I was 9, my mom convinced me to give it a second chance. So, I watched ""Ghostbusters"" again, and I laughed my head off. I felt so idiotic for having gotten scared by something so hilarious. As everyone knows, the story has Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) battling spooks in New York, and they have to go up against an ancient evil god. Among the supporting characters, one finds musician Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) and dorky Louis Tully (Rick Moranis).Probably what embarrassed me the most about getting scared by ""Ghostbusters"" was the fact that I didn't even interpret Louis Tully and his mishaps. The first time that I watched the movie, I literally did not realize that his character was there.Anyway, this is a veritable comedy classic. It was like nothing that had ever come before. With a catchy theme song (that I play every Halloween), this is a movie that's impossible not to like.Oh, and I should probably explain the ""black and white"" part. When my parents taped ""Ghostbusters"" off of the TV, it was in color on the TV but it came out black and white on the tape. My parents have never been able to figure that out, so their only explanation is that the tape was haunted. If so, then this was the perfect movie to record onto it."," The first time that I ever watched this movie, it scared me (don't worry; I later found it funny)."

"197","Ghostbusters","abalpn-99472","10/10","8 October 2019","I like this film. I have the DVD collection of Ghostbusters 1 and 2. I even liked the music video of Ray Parker Jr. ""He slimed me"" and ""I feel so funky"". Those are my favorite lines from Bill Murray. Harold Ramis was the greatest Egon. Dan Aykroyd is great playing Ray and Ernie Hudson is the coolest as Winston. Wow. It's been 35 years since Ghostbusters debuted in the theaters.My favorite characters are Slimer and Stay Puft in ""The Real Ghostbusters"". I've watched some of the episodes on YouTube.The special effects with the ghosts are great and superb. Reitman and the whole crew knew what they were doing with the effects and the characters.

"199","Ghostbusters","KingBrian1","10/10","16 December 2014","Director Ivan Reitman brings us classic movie magic, Ghostbusters. Major stars, Bill Murray, Dan Akyroyd, Signourey Weaver & Harold Ramis also starring Rick Moranis and Ernie Hudson. It tells the story of three Ghost hunters that discover New York is a hive of supernatural activity. In this hilarious movie the three decide to set up a business that catches ghosts and spirits, they recruit a fourth member and they wind up uncovering an ancient prophesy foretelling the rise of a Sumerian Goddess.A tribute to the great city of New York, Bill Murray is exceptional as the cynical Ghostbuster. The soundtrack that accompanies this movie is epic. From Slimer to the Marshmallow Man and the Vicious Dog the special effects for the time were quite good. A real sense of fun permeates the film. Good natured and suitable for all age groups. 80's film like this has become a cinematic classic."," Great 80's movie"
"200","Ghostbusters","bravesman1983","10/10","5 November 2003","Ghostbusters is by far the greatest movie in the history of modern cinema. It may seem corny at first, but in order to really appreciate it you have to watch it a few times.  Or a couple hundred, like me.  Bill Murray is great, providing the obvious jokes and sarcastic comments.  Dan Akyroid is great as well, but I think that Harold Ramis is the best in Ghostbusters.  You have to watch him and pay attention to what he says, or else you'll end up missing the funniest (yet most subtle) moments.  Add straight guy Ernie Hudson and 80s big time hottie Sigourney Weaver to the mix, and this cast is awesome.  The scene in the mayor's office........priceless.  Listening to Murray call the EPA guy Pecker instead of his real name Peck, wow.  ""Yes it's true.....this man has no dick.""  The funniest line in any movie ever, no matter how childish you may think it is."," The Greatest Movie Ever"
