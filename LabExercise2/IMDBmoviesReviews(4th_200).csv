"1","Late Night with the Devil","dbutle-34095","7/10","25 March 2024","At first I was giving this movie a 6 out of 10 I walked out of the movie theater thinking what in the hell did I just watch I thought it was pretty entertaining for the most part because of the acting and just the overall suspense of the movie wondering what's going to happen next and at first the ending was really not as exciting of a climax for myself personally that I prefer in a movie. Afterwards talking it over with my wife who was with me we both agreed that the movie is more of a psychological thriller cult comedy and that there were a lot of subtle hints throughout the movie and any questions that may have been on your mind throughout the movie can be answered visually throughout the movie rather than just coming straight out and telling you like so many other movies do by the end so leaving the movie theater or your first watch of the movie you may not understand but talking it over with my wife I see a lot of understanding for what the movie was portraying and it definitely is a movie that you have to pay attention to the story and pay attention to what they're saying and pay attention visually to really understand it all in all a good movie I changed my rating to an eight out of 10 just for the fact that I thought it could have been more of an exciting movie than it probably would have gotten a 10 out of 10 but either way definitely worth a watch I'm going to watch it again just so I can see the story matching up like I realized afterwards when I was talking about it with my wife."," This movie leaves you thinking afterwards"
"2","Late Night with the Devil","jwburke94","7/10","24 March 2024","I went to see this movie with my wife, we love horror movies and this is one I was excited to see. This was definitely a film that was unique in different ways. I loved how it was shot, it was a blast from the past. The first half of the film had great pacing, it kept you on your toes and never knew what to expect. The actors in it were fantastic. The thing was the last thirty minutes of the film. It was definitely going to be something where I am going to have to look up what it meant. It did not make much sense and that's okay. I liked how it was a different type of horror movie in almost every way. It wasn't bad, I thought that it could've finished in a different way."," An interesting film"
"3","Late Night with the Devil","me-18422","6/10","23 March 2024","If you're someone who likes the Exorcist / Omen genre, maybe try Late Night With The Devil that adds a 1970s late-night talk show spin on those films. Is this movie a mess? Yes it definitely is. Is it entertaining? Yeah okay sure. I love the 1970s aesthetic and the lead actors playing Jack and Gus are both really good. I particularly enjoyed the practical horror effects and it has some fun jump scares, but to me it isn't scary. I've always been confused about that whole concept that those Exorcist / Omen movies are built on. When the demon-possessed character starts levitating or vomiting bile, that's so funny to me and I can't help but break out laughing. I also think it's hilarious how Bohemian Grove is incorporated into the plot. And the references to Anton Szandor Lavey are cringe too. I laughed way more than anyone else in the movie theater. It doesn't ultimately matter whether I was laughing at the movie or with it, but I don't want to analyze too much about what's going on with people who'd actually find this scary."," It's a mess but it's fun."
"4","Late Night with the Devil","niebo76","6/10","5 April 2024","I did enjoy the cinematography blended with color and some black and white which if I recall correctly was whenever the ""late show"" would go into commercial breaks while focusing on the off-air dialogues. What I didn't like about the movie was that there were moments when the character development took longer than I would've expected.The ending to me was odd and maybe more in tune with what a 70's horror movie would represent. In either case I found the ending confusing and with a lack of surprise, shock or awe which is what I expect in horror films.Personally, I felt that the climax of the movie was done poorly and left me disappointed."," A bit disappointed"
"5","Late Night with the Devil","LikeallHungarians","3/10","3 April 2024","I watched Late Night with the Devil late at night (but in a sparsely attended showing a chain multiplex). From the trailers and press releases, I was mildly interested--it takes a lot for me to not just give any satanic possession movie a watch (like Immaculate looking utterly unoriginal)--and certain circumstances conspired for me to spend $5 on a ticket.The product feels like a first film, particularly babby's first screenplay, as there are certain original ideas floating around, and interesting approaches for tropes, yet ultimately not the right expertise to pull it off, as ultimately the director(s) don't have anything to add to the genre other than a form that has seen something of a resurgence in interest: as a total fan of The Eric Andre Show, I love '70s late-night talk show period stylings as much as anyone, but the set dressing isn't enough to carry a demonic possession picture when the movie itself mentions--and that introduction is horribly over-extended, with all that framing poorly executed anyways, as the voiceover is supposedly contextualizing this as some TV special yet without the feel of what we actually see on TV, with all kinds of filler imagery and words that we certainly don't need by this point--all the evil that actually existed at the time--indeed, this feels like Halloween shlock, which makes the April release ill-fitting, instead ending up something destined to be shown as an actual rerun on TVs during that season.The performances are by & large sub-par in a lack of talent way, not camp. Maybe that is the legacy of '70s television, but it means that era will be much better remembered for Amityville."," A high concept that fails to deliver"
"6","Late Night with the Devil","geraldj-10740","1/10","30 March 2024","WTH?! Went into this after reading all the great reviews and yes the devil is a liar! This has to be the worst ""horror"" movie of all time. It's unbelievably stupid and insulting to any paying audience. As a matter of fact, I would not even get paid to watch this movie again. The deception of this being horror is far beyond reality of what horror really is. The only horror is.......this movie actually made it to the theaters and is going to make more than a dollar! My girlfriend looked at me and said......really this is the movie you were raving about?! All I could say was....... I don't know what the hell we just watched but the devil is laughing at all of us even more for getting deceived! Not even a zero out of ten!"," The Devil is a LIAR!"
"7","Late Night with the Devil","jmjmartinez","9/10","23 March 2024","PLEAS WATCH IN THEATERS AT NIGHT BEFORE READING ANY REVIEW.I use IMDb pretty often but I never made an account until now!!! I made it specifically for this movie. I just came out of the theater struck with awe and amazement at how a horror movie could make me feel on edge and refreshed. My girlfriend and I can't stop talking about how during the movie we felt like children getting scarred by some random disturbing video we found on YouTube or how it made us feel like we were experiencing paranormal in person. Kind of nostalgic in that sense. Polka dot man and his supporting actors did a stellar job and the talk show setting is was an outstanding idea for a horror film. Some of the visuals were a bit cheap but they didn't really talke me out of the movie. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. This is definitely in my top favorite horror movies alongside the terrifier movies and evil dead."," AMAZING AND REFRESHING"
"8","Late Night with the Devil","dyingxmidwestern-1","8/10","31 March 2024","Hype around this one has been buzzing for what seems like years, and i'm relieved to say it's mostly warranted. To distill a review down to its most basic form, this film is actually F U N and entertaining. Ya know... how movies used to feel? And to my shock and surprise the filmmakers even managed to write an ending. (something missing from nearly every film i've seen this year)the plot synopsis tells you everything you need to know, and while the recently released trailer does reveal perhaps a bit too much, the experience still feels fresh and you're happy to be along for the ride. Some overly-ham-fisted acting (defenders will say intentional) does ding the film a couple of points, but overall this was one of the most enjoyable movie theater experiences i've had in a while. *even my wife loved it, who is not typically a horror fan* strong recommend."," the first decent horror film of 2024?"
"9","Late Night with the Devil","jameshannon","10/10","30 March 2024","I finally found a local theater showing Late Night with the Devil with David Dastmalchian and bee-lined over to Scotch Plains to go see it.... If you know me, you know why I wanted to see it, but also everyone I know who saw it couldn't stop talking about it. So there was extra motivation to go see it (even on Good Friday )#DavidDastmalchian plays a 1970s late night tv host who is trying to beat Johnny Carson. And after some ups and downs, he put on an episode called #ConversationsWithTheDevil and it's exactly what it sounds like. And of course things get out of hand. #NoSpoilersIt is an excellent movie and David really shines as a late night host - to the point where he needs his own show in real life. He goes from being the schmoozy host to being sincere to being ""HolyCrap! What is he doing???""I love the way the story was presented as if it were a news report investigating what happened. It was very different and refreshing from what I'm used to seeing. The rest of the cast were amazing as well and I can't explain why without giving spoilers - but they all played their parts wonderfully.This was a movie where I wasn't looking at my watch every 15 minutes - the time flew by. Even my wife Jackie loved it and it isn't her normal type of movie.Go watch it, this is going to be a sleeper hit when more people hear about it and it gets into more theaters!"," Uniquely presented and solid movie that kept us engaged!"
"10","Late Night with the Devil","taylorcarlstrom","5/10","31 March 2024","I was misguided by the 7.5 score, not realizing it hasn't had time to marinate. I appreciate the aesthetic that shudder aimed for, but the story fell flat. The narrative is lacking many key points that could have help build the plot, to which I still don't know.. It was simply boring in my opinion. I was lulled to sleep, waiting for a jumping off point. The bits and pieces of somewhat enthusiastic scenes simply smothered like a poorly lit fire! Right when you think things are picking up, you are sent into a confusing spiral of an ending that doesn't satisfy any of your needs in the horror genre."," The potential was there..."
"11","Late Night with the Devil","GabeDoesReviews","6/10","3 April 2024","Late Night with the Devil commits to its unique style and presentation but often stumbles along the way with its smaller details. I absolutely love the way this film tries to replicate old lost media with its camera work and production design. Even when the audio was crystal clear and could've been put through a filter to replicate an older sound, it didn't distract me too much since most of the performances had me completely sold. What really leaves me unsatisfied is the overall pace. In between each segment is ""behind the scenes footage"" that just reiterates what had happened earlier. However, there are moments where it works in delivering information to the audience. Maybe I would've liked to see some cursed commercials in between all the footage. The film also stretches out some of its horror concepts while also not committing more to some. Just as things are about to get interesting, the film moves on to the next idea without fully developing the previous one. I know I sound harsh but I still had a great time overall. It's one of the better horror movies to come out recently and is worth the watch."," An amazing concept that doesn't fully land its execution."
"12","Late Night with the Devil","Skruffbagg","7/10","2 April 2024","I had heard many reviews that this was both the best and scariest horror film in years... In truth, it's neither, but it's still a solid film with some excellent performances, decent scares and a fun way to waste 90 minutes.In a nutshell, David Dastmalchian (fantastic) is a late night talk show host climbing the ladder of success who, after suffering a personal tragedy, takes several months off before returning to failing ratings. In an effort to win back the audience, he resorts to more desperate and controversial topics, culminating in a live hallowe'en special featuring a phoney psychic, sceptic/former magician, and one supposedly possessed girl. Despite several eerie and foreboding moments during the show, he manipulates the girl's parapsychologist - who also happens to be his love interest- into performing a demonic summoning live on tv... and this is when the proverbial excrement hits the fan.The film is done in a ""found footage"" style, with a 70s aesthetic (including grainy picture and 4:3 ratio) and while it works for the most part, the inconsistencies in the footage and style were a bit too obvious and hard to ignore. There are some AI generated images which I personally didn't care about, but again, they stood out. The performances as a whole were good, but Dastmalchian and Ingrid Torelli were both superb, elevating the material to greater heights. There's some good gore and light scares, but if you're looking for a terror inducing experience, this isn't it. It's campy fun done in an original and interesting way, and despite reading several complaints about it, I thought the ending was just fine. There's enough info and context throughout the movie to let you make own mind up about what happened and why, but if you need it spelled out any further you should probably watch something less challenging, like Fast X.Definitely worth your time if you're a genre fan that likes a simple scary story told in an interesting way."," Original, fun, good... but not great"
"13","Late Night with the Devil","darrylmsmith","6/10","4 April 2024","These high ratings have to be hyped reviews. Whenever someone sees something at a film festival or a pre screening people feel like what they are watching is special.This is an okay movie. As someone who actually grew up in the 70s they did a great job with the 70s feel without being too campy.I watch A LOT of movies, so it all was so predictable, but not completely disappointing. No one in the theater looked surprised when the ""twist"" was revealed. It's not even a twist.The actor who played Lilly - wow. At first I thought she was a bit old to play 13, but as I watched her acting she drew me right in. Her intense looks really gave the movie an agitated feeling.It moves slow as a horror movie, but it is an entertaining 70s throwback until the ""horror""
unfolds."," Don't trust the high ratings"
"14","Late Night with the Devil","ucladude1","9/10","4 April 2024","I didn't know anything about the movie before going. I read reviews on here and they didn't tell me about the plot , but they made me want to watch it. Part of the motivation to watch this was having zero clues with the movie is about literally zero clue. Even while watching it, I still didn't have much clue what it was about. Yes, you can kind of see what the movie is about but you really really really aren't sure.The talkshow host made the movie a little bit confusing. It was hard to understand where his mind was with what's happening. Is he in one way saying things because he wants to save his show or does he believe what really is going on?You've got to watch to see what you believe is going on. Even then, you might not believe what you think you believe."," Could've been a 10"
"15","Late Night with the Devil","salmon62","6/10","4 April 2024","I really admire how much work went into this film.The 70's ethic was recreated believably and the set and wardrobe folks are to be commended. As are the sound people.The movie is comprised of found footage or previously unreleased footage of a TV talk show which featured some special Halloween guests to boost ratings.The host has his own tragic, sensational backstory to add to the plot of what takes place in the hour-long talk show episode.The story is compelling and tragic and has some references to the occult participation of the protagonist talk show celebrity.The issue I note with the movie is the individual segments of the guests who each have a few moments of terror in the film. These subsections of the film come off as separate chapters and take away from the focus of the film, the title, the Late Night with the devil interview.Other than this disjointed assembly of characters, the film is entertaining for its throwback qualities and the interesting characters assembled."," Very entertaining but a bit disjointed"
"16","Late Night with the Devil","adamgeraghty-51989","8/10","25 March 2024","Late Night with the devil, a wonderfully twisted take on a talk show gone wrong with demonic possession and witch-craft.I find this film an all-around home run. On an acting, story and technical sense, it all works. It delivers its concept well as it really commits to the time period with a 70s talk show. It's a comfortable film as you really feel as though you're in along for the ride as you, the viewer would be watch everything unfold. You may jump in your seats, but I will say this is a jumpscare lite horror film as if they are there any they aren't the main source of the horror. This film is built on atmosphere as it's one of the benefits of keeping it to this confined studio setting.The main man, who's the face of the show and the movie, is that of David Dastmalchain, who really does carry this movie on his shoulders. I find Dastmalchain as clever cast, though you might not recognise him by name he's had a colourful career from The Dark Night to Dune. There's a pretty decent chance that you'd recognise him even if he wasn't in the leading role. All of this adds to his character as Jack Delroy, a TV presenter who's like a close friend you know who's been through thick and thin. Dastmalchain has plenty of charm and charisma as he works off his co-stars naturally. He also is someone who can do so masterfully a nervous smile as he tells it all to you with just his face.This is something that can be said about every member of the cast as every character feels like they're a real person giving their genuine reaction to the event that are unfolding before them. Though there is something very artificial about the setting with the lights, cameras and the live studio audience. There's very little that very little that's phoney about it. Everyone is a distinct and different person.I find very few things that don't work for me but to list a few. The opening is a bit jarring as the main purpose is just to make sure that you know what's going on. It's something that kind of needs to be there as there's not much of a workaround for something like that, but once it's out of the way, you'll settle into everything nicely. There are few digital effects that are just downright awful. Even with that low quality 70s grain that doesn't hide the cheapness of the effect. Now, this also is hard to list as so many effects are so visceral and real, while the bad ones are only in passing. Also, this movie was shot for penies and when there is a very cheap budget, they work with what they are given.This is a film which gives you what you'd want out of the concept but also sticks the landing. It's something that I'd recommend if you crave a 70s aesthetic."," If you crave a 70s aesthetics I'd recommend it."
"17","Late Night with the Devil","mikegjones-19994","10/10","24 March 2024","This movie is so freaking awesome, I love how different and refreshing this style of paranormal feels. Its not your typical ""possession and exorcism"" style of movie. The aspect of having as a late night show really takes you in and immerses you, from the ad breaks to how the camera works of late 70's. I really hope we get more movies like this in the future. David Dastmalchian is awesome and charming in his role aa a late night host. Very happy to see him get the main spotlight finally, feels like he always get sidelined in all his projects. I can def see this become one of my standard Halloween marathon movie."," Fresh and new"
"18","Late Night with the Devil","RaveReviewerzzz","4/10","3 April 2024","""Late Night with the Devil"" attempts to blend horror and satire within the found-footage genre, but ultimately falls short of its ambitions, earning a 4 out of 10 rating. The film's premise-a 1970s talk show host battling for ratings during a live Halloween special that goes awry-promises a mix of laughs and scares. However, the execution is where the film stumbles.The Cairnes brothers' direction shows flashes of brilliance, particularly in the nostalgic recreation of the '70s TV aesthetic and the use of practical effects. Yet, the narrative feels disjointed, with the found-footage format feeling more like a gimmick than a storytelling device. The humor, intended to be diabolically funny, often misses the mark, leaving the audience unsure whether to laugh or cringe.David Dastmalchian's portrayal of Jack Delroy, the desperate talk show host, is commendable but is let down by a script that lacks depth and originality. The supporting cast delivers uneven performances, with some characters feeling underdeveloped and others bordering on caricature.The film's critique of television's corrupting influence and the lengths one would go for fame is a well-trodden path, offering little in the way of new insight. While ""Late Night with the Devil"" has its moments-particularly in the design and special effects departments-it ultimately doesn't deliver the cohesive experience that fans of horror-comedy crave.In conclusion, ""Late Night with the Devil"" is a film that had potential but didn't quite manage to deliver on its premise."," Not scary, not original, not funny."
"19","Late Night with the Devil","renohuskies","9/10","2 April 2024","Late Night with the Devil, directed by Australian brothers Cameron and Colin Cairnes, is a supernatural horror film that masterfully blends satire, shocks, and eerie nostalgia. Set in the 1970s, this found-footage gem delivers a wickedly entertaining take on late-night talk shows and demonic possession.David Dastmalchian, known for his standout supporting performances in major movies, finally gets his well-deserved lead role. His portrayal of the ambitious talk show host Jack Delroy is note-perfect-slippery, needy, and insincere. Dastmalchian's eerie charisma makes him a perfect fit for horror fans craving psychological thrills.The film revolves around a Halloween night special episode of Night Owls, a struggling syndicated talk show. Facing cancellation, Jack Delroy invites a purportedly possessed girl onto the program to boost ratings. The result is a Faustian pact that trades dignity, morality, and even lives for a share of the ratings figures. The film's blend of satire, cynicism, and devilish humor disrupts the demonic possession genre, leaving viewers both entertained and spooked.Late Night with the Devil shares thematic elements with classic horror anthology shows like Tales from the Crypt very similar to the episode ""Television Terror"". Both explore the dark side of television, but while Tales from the Crypt focuses on passive consumption, Late Night...delves into its creation. The film hints at a Faustian bargain made for ratings, echoing the eerie allure of classic horror tales. It's as if the devil has taken control of the late-night airwaves, and viewers are in for a chilling ride.With top-notch performances, stellar scares, and a pitch-perfect '70s atmosphere, Late Night with the Devil is poised to become a Halloween classic. Its blend of diabolical humor found footage style, and supernatural intrigue ensures it will haunt viewers long after the credits roll.Prepare to be entertained and spooked as Late Night with the Devil takes the stage as a new horror gem, destined to become a Halloween favorite for years to come!"," Late Night with the Devil: A Diabolically Fun Horror Gem"

"25","Late Night with the Devil","comps-784-38265","7/10","31 March 2024","What I liked :
After a lot of mediocre 'horror' films, with lame lighting, lame 'jump scares' , lame acting and plot holes you could drive a train through. At last something that is of a higher standard and a bit different.Set in a 1970's TV studio for a late show (not the usual old church/monastry) with 'ordinary' people (not nuns and priests)Yes there is poor lighting and cheap sets - but (at last) with good reason - it is set in a tv studio 'set'.Even more unusual you can watch, it's not totally predictable , e.g. Here comes a jump scare, when he looks in the mirror there will be a shape in the back ground etcVery interesting scenario, a halloween late night chat show, the host interviews a possessed child, her paraphysycologist doctor, a sceptic, and a medium. All live 'on air' with breaks for advertising.Liked the scenario of you are part of the audience watching the live screening.What I didn't like
I felt the ending could have been tied up better. References to the secret club and sacrifices didn't tally up. I thought the ending was left 'hanging' to a degree.But well worth a watch, something different, that relies on telling a story rather than dim lighting, jump scares and gore.

"27","Late Night with the Devil","kevin_robbins","9/10","16 March 2024","My wife and I attended an advanced screening of Late Night with the Devil (2023) at Alamo Drafthouse last night. The plot revolves around a late-night talk show host struggling to surpass Johnny Carson's ratings despite various attempts, even involving his terminally ill wife joining the show. The host, known for his involvement in a cult, mysteriously disappears for a month after his wife's death, only to return with even lower ratings. With one last chance to save his show, he decides to take drastic measures.Co-directed by Cameron and Colin Cairnes (Scary Campaign), the film features a stellar cast including David Dastmalchian (The Suicide Squad), Laura Gordon (Undertow), Ian Bliss (The Matrix Reloaded), Fayssal Bazzi (Shantaram), Ingrid Torelli (Bloom), and Rhys Auteri (A Good Deed).Late Night with the Devil is a phenomenal movie, with a magnificent concept and flawless execution. Every aspect, from sets to costumes to performances, contributes to an authentic atmosphere. While some elements may be over-the-top, they serve to captivate the audience. The film maintains a dark, mysterious tone through smart subplots and unpredictable twists, culminating in a satisfying conclusion that ties everything together to perfection.The acting is outstanding across the board, with special mention to child actor Ingrid Torelli, who delivers a standout performance. Every character's facial expressions and reactions are compelling, drawing the audience into every scene. The kills are gruesome and perfectly executed. There's a tremendous use of worms that brought a smile to my face.

"30","Late Night with the Devil","moviemanmo973","7/10","22 March 2024","The opening narration does a great job at setting the tone for the rest of the film. It gives off that creepy mystery documentary vibe and it draws you into the story right away. The narration provides us with a quick summary about Jack Delroy (David Dastmalchian) without spending too much time building up his character. Usually that would be a negative but it does it in such an interesting way that we are automatically intrigued by the character. The narration also sets up the story perfectly by letting us know that we will be witnessing an episode from this late night talk show that goes horribly wrong.The episode begins and we are entranced into this 70's talk show. It does feel like we are watching this show at home. With each guest being interviewed and building upon this Halloween episode. The host makes jokes and interacts with the live audience members and even cuts to commercial breaks. But instead of commercials we get insight into the behind the scenes footage of this programing. All of this builds the story and is fun to watch.David Dastmalchian delivers a very believable performance as a 70's late night talk show host. All of the cast does a great job and their chemistry helps to sell this story. The production design and the wardrobes are also well done.Where the film fails is in its ending because the build up just didn't pay off. The ending feels rushed and the film could have benefited from a longer run time after it spent so much time building up this story. The ending isn't terrible but may seem confusing. Some might find the ending enjoyable but personally I thought the character Lily should have been explored more. The film seemed more terrifying when she was more of the focus. Instead the film downplays the horror elements and dishes out an overall theme of ""the price of fame"". Not to mention there are also some scenes with special effects that seem dated and diminished the films early efforts.I would still recommend this film but I expect many not to enjoy the ending."," An enjoyable film with an ending that might not please everyone"

The way the movie is very much just like watching a chat show on television and how it goes for the interval and we see backstage is freaking cool. I think the ending was very strange and as I said earlier unique to say the least. Dalmastchian does a grand job and hope this gets him some more unusual horror flicks. I always liked the way on the big screen it was just like an old 70's TV screen. I would like to rate the movie higher but the movie for me was too short."," Unusually good"

Late Night With The Devil sucks you in and keeps you held in horrified suspense in an era you might not've even been alive for. Lol If you love the paranormal, occult, and horror there's countless Easter eggs, and I might've even spied some uncredited actors just to further add to the wtf is happening factor. Idk how the hell they made this thing look so good, the perfect grain, the perfect colors, the perfect cast, every little thing was flawless, and so charming. This is unlike anything you've ever watched. It's an instant classic. And it was well well worth the wait."," This was made for me."
"33","Late Night with the Devil","DanLawson146","8/10","24 March 2024","POSITIVES:1) The performances are brilliant. Jack is clearly the lead and David does a great job with him; it's quite a wide ranging performance in the sense that on the one hand he's this overly charismatic TV host, but on the other hand he becomes increasingly unnerved as the events of the film transpire. I also thought the young girl playing Lilly was really terrific and had the perfect balance between charming and creepy
2) As my title suggests, I was really impressed by how the film utilises its low budget. Setting the film all in one studio was a great idea as it adds a claustrophobic atmosphere to the film, and I also loved how the film is a tight 90 minutes as it means it never feels boring or like it's overstaying its welcome
3) I think this is a film that I'll remember very well amongst all the other films I see. I loved the theme of this TV host who is at heart a good person but has been corrupted by his lust for fame. I also found it pleasantly unique. Moments such as Carmichael hypnotising everyone in the studio, whilst also seeming to hypnotise us as the audience too, were very well done and the film in general is very well madeNEGATIVES:1) There are certainly moments where you can tell that the filmmakers were struggling to capture what they wanted to show whilst working with such a low budget. I thought the special effects in general were very ropey. Moments such as the projectile vomiting or the worm infestations just looked really bad if I'm being brutally honest
2) I'm someone who's quite easily scared by horror films, but I have to say I didn't find this film scary at all. The hand appearing on Jack's shoulder was the only moment that even gave me the chills, and I never once felt genuinely scared. To me, the film felt like it was slowly building towards this great horrific climax, but in the end I felt that the ending was somewhat of a let down because it's more about Jack's psychological breakdown than it is about genuine horror."," Low budget filmmaking done right"
"34","Late Night with the Devil","cdjh-81125","8/10","27 March 2024","I don't really think you can, or really should, talk about this movie without at least addressing it's use of AI in the creation of some of its images. Personally I do feel a bit disappointed that the filmmakers chose to take that step. It's not something I support and I don't think there are any justifiable reasons for its use in the creation of art. Having said that though I would rather a film of this scale and smaller budget use it in the creation of a few frames rather than a blockbuster of considerably more resources creating whole pages of dialogue or fully rendered scenes or sequences. I've been gratified at the intense response it's provoked here because the less acknowledgment it has the easier it'll be for studio heads to expand AI use in their future productions.To the judge the film purely on its quality however, I thought this was a totally gripping experience and one of the most unique executions of a horror premise I've seen. I totally fell for the aesthetic these filmmakers were trying to create and I was frequently in awe at how successfully executed it was. It never felt like they were just going for a found footage format with a 70's filter over it. Everything from the grainy quality of the images and the slight echo added to all of the audio is done in aid of the recreation of this era of television. Although I was frequently impressed with it but thankfully more often than not I forgot about it and just became taken by the ride this movie takes you on.It's not just the technical aspects either, the dialogue and character interactions feel so genuine and like they're ripped straight out of a classic episode of Johnny Carson or Dick Cavett. A lot of this success is also owed to David Dastmalchian who I've always loved as an actor in the usually smaller roles he's given and I got a total kick out of seeing him lead a film like this. He's essentially giving 2 performances; the on screen persona of a talk show host and the man we see behind the scenes and he pulls it all off perfectly. He manages to be funny and totally effecting in a way that made me never quite sure how to feel about the character and those are the kind of protagonists I really love, especially when it comes to horror.My issues only really come down do how the directors deviate from the rules they establish for themselves. We frequently follow the character in the behind-the-scenes portions of the show and it isn't always handled with the same restraint that the on-air scenes are. Too often it felt like they resorted to normal shot compositions with a black-and-white filter and it did sometimes break the illusion the rest of the movie was going for. There's also a pretty large exposition dump that opens the film which felt like it was trying way too hard to deliver background on this character rather than spoon feeding it more naturally throughout the rest of the narrative. I also thought the third act went a little bit off the rails for what the rest of the film was trying to set up but I never didn't find it effective.I truly think that the AI discourse should be, and needs to be, a part of the conversation surrounding this movie but I don't want that to eclipse just how fantastic it really is. I found this quite inspiring as a filmmaker and I have so much respect for the vision these directors went for with this film and just how well they executed it. After how many duds 2024 has given us so far, Dune: Part Two aside, seeing a film of this originality really made me happy. People craving originality in theirs movies really should be going out their way to see Late Night with The Devil because I've never seen a horror film quite like this one."," Original and Totally Effecting"

He got more than he bargained for. Obviously, things were going to go horribly wrong, and they did - horribly.This is - almost - a gloriously original movie, or at least it's an original twist on familiar tropes, in the vein of, let's say, Scary Movie. Some projectile vomiting heralds the inevitable ""hommage"" to THE EXORCIST. Lilly, the possessed girl (Ingrid Torelli), is clearly referencing Linda Blair, but she reminded me a bit of Pamela Franklin (THE INNOCENTS, 1961).LATE NIGHT WITH THE DEVIL is unusually short, less than 90 mins.

It manages to be stylistic and at the same time hit off on the beats of a traditional possession story, while being suspenseful.I appreciate a movie that takes its time to settle you into its world, and LNWTD did just that. The quest for ratings and hunger for fame can make people do horrible things, and that's seen in the limits that the audience and host are pushed to.There are better possession stories out there, but this movie succeeds in allowing you to laugh at what's happening in between commercial breaks, but also be genuinely horrified at what you're watching.

"38","Late Night with the Devil","brentsbulletinboard","7/10","26 March 2024","How far are you willing to go in realizing your ambitions? Would you be willing to make big sacrifices? Associate with shady beings? Sell your soul? Those are among the possibilities raised in the latest hair-raising smart horror/comedy from the writing-directing duo of Cameron and Colin Cairnes. This documentary-style offering presents the supposedly lost recording (complete with allegedly never-before-seen found footage) of a 1970s late night talk show hosted by comedian/TV personality Jack Delroy (David Dastmalchian) whose goal is to unseat Johnny Carson's eminently popular Tonight Show as the premier after-hours choice of viewing. Delroy's Night Owls broadcast is modestly successful, but it never manages to win the late night ratings race, so he desperately looks for ways to nudge his program over the top. When he decides to host a Halloween show with an array of occult/paranormal guests - capitalizing on a growing trend at the time - he believes he's hit on the formula to achieve his goal. But, as the show progresses, he finds himself in over his head as events begin to spiral out of control. Viewers both on and off the screen are kept in suspense with a well-integrated blend of humor, high camp and unexpectedly spooky moments involving a hammy, self-righteous psychic medium (Fayssal Bazzi), an egomanical magician-turned-debunker (Ian Bliss), and an escaped teenage cult member (Ingrid Torelli) and her psychologist caregiver/surrogate parent (Laura Gordon). As things deteriorate, Jack tries to hold the show together with the aid of his producer (Josh Quong Tart) and flunky sidekick (Rhys Auteri). But, as the stakes are continually upped, that task grows ever more difficult, especially when supernatural influences begin to assert themselves in the studio, threatening both the broadcast and the fulfillment of the host's long-cherished dream. Although occasional pacing issues, a periodically disjointed narrative and a somewhat overblown final act can get in the way of the smoothness of the story flow, these shortcomings are made up for by the film's superb period piece production design, its clever writing and its fine performances, most notably that of the protagonist. And, in the end, it's all served up with lots of laughs and a tidy moral of the story. Admittedly, ""Late Night with the Devil"" probably would have worked better as a Halloween release than a piece of springtime movie fare, but that doesn't lessen the entertainment value of this inspired production, one thar shows horror flicks can indeed do more than just see how high it can make the final body count."," A Devilishly Good Time"
"39","Late Night with the Devil","christopher-underwood","7/10","31 March 2024","I have to say that this is a rather original and really good effort of making a thrilling horror, with a nod towards Exorcist and Amityville.

I realise that we are being drawn into this and it is rather clever and we have almost forgotten about the horror. Of course we enjoy the way the program is made and with all the advert breaks, the short music introductions and the unfunny jokes. David Dastmalchian is brilliant, he doesn't put a foot wrong also Ingrid Torelli is almost even better. She is a young Australian girl with her first film and amazing although I understand that she was had a wonderful run in 2016 with Matilda the Musical in Melbourne but she certainly had a different role in this one with a lovely look in her eye, she is a bit of a devil."," a nod towards Exorcist and Amityville"

Even having seen 500+ horror films, I can't compare this to anything else. It's not groundbreaking or mind-blowing, but it's different and original.It's also really good, well-made in most aspects. It hooks you early on, even before any of the horror starts. For a while you're just enjoying a fabricated late night TV talk show. And then when the horror kicks in, oh does it kick. There are a few memorable and jaw-dropping scenes.My headline is referring to something that drives me crazy. People, including close friends, complain that Hollywood has run out of ideas and only makes sequels, remakes and superhero movies. I respond by showing them all of the original movies released in a year, and how they did not watch any of them. They only go to the theaters a few times a year, and only for the blockbusters. What they're complaining about is their own fault.If you're a fan of horror and are looking for something far from traditional, Late Night with the Devil is for you.

"41","Late Night with the Devil","bowmanblue","8/10","1 April 2024","Those long-term horror fans will remember 1999's 'The Blair Witch Project' and how it brought (back?) the 'found footage' sub-genre which was a cheaper way of making horror films and stayed around for about a decade or so before the gimmick became old hat.'Late Night With the Devil' is effectively 'found footage,' only with a nice period gloss of paint on it and presented in the form of a 70s late night American TV show, rather than the usual video camera footage. If you can get past the heavy 'information dump' which makes up the first five minutes, we learn that a late night TV talk show will do anything to save its failing ratings and so the producers conspire with the host to create a 'memorable' halloween special to scare their viewers. Naturally, they - and the audience - gets more than they bargained for.First of all, the film's charm is in its presentation. It doesn't come across as overtly 'found footage' and the attention to detail to make it seem like it was a genuine television program from the seventies is truly great. Everyone plays their parts well and kudos to not just the presenter, but also the younger actress who plays the 'centre' of the paranormal activities.It's quite a 'slow build' as much of the first half of the show is... well, effectively just the first half of a 'variety' TV show - not much happens that isn't supposed to. Naturally, as the broadcast progresses, things get further out of hand. There are a couple of horrific moments, but they're few and far between and the ending is beautifully chaotic.I think it's worth noting that there's actually quite a lot of humour in this 'horror' film, making it more of a 'black-comedy horror' rather than an outright gore/scare-fest. Whether you're a fan of the found footage sub-genre of horror, were around in the seventies and need a shot of nostalgia, or just like your horror films, this film is a nice departure from your average modern horror film with no ump scares and real attention to detail and cheeky fun."," Found footage films revamped"

From start to finish they really did a great job with the build up to the climax of this movie. I also appreciated a lot of the practical effects used on some of what would be the creepier / scarier scenes.

When the horror hits, it's a very unique take, and, for myself and those I went with to see it, the climax, especially the last 20 minutes, does not disappoint. The setting is really well done, the production design is terrific. It feels very true to the late '70s, and it manages to create a great sense of its own logic and a tangible sense of reality.

They really should have went all in with the 70's theme and used practical effects to fit with the asthetic.The narrative is not as original as some people think. The haunted TV show has been done before and much better. I would refer the reader to seek out the BBC drama Ghostwatch, which caused a genuine sensation when it was aired. Because so many people thought it was real. That show has genuine casualties. Late Night is simply not in the same league. For one too much of this is played for laughs and its simply not that scary. Its obvious from the very beginning where the story will and you are basically waiting for this finale throughout the movie. The acting and the film are good enough to keep you engaged, it just doesn't feel like a satisfying climax considering the lead up. This certainly feels like a Garth Marenghi episode but done more seriously and with fewer gags that land. Sorry to disappoint but this is not the hugely original 10/10 movie some are suggesting. Seriously, for the haunted TV Show trope, seek out Ghostwatch and keep in mind that this was actually broadcast on national TV to an unsuspecting public.

His rise to just below the summit and his fall to the Hell that lies beneath.The film plays with the fake documentary/found footage genre in a way that does not oversaturate an already saturated and trope-filled genre. The dynamic use of intertitles and black-and-white ""behind the scenes"" shots give us an idea of what truly happened on Jack Delroy's Night Owls Halloween Special.Tension is key in all films such as this, the slow build but not to slow, but not to fast, little bit slower and eventually you reach the right pacing and build of tension. Many films attempt this but only a few perfect it and this film is one of them. The moment we find out Christou died it only ramps up more.The necessary unsettling feeling for all films like these is peppered throughout the film but is brought to the forefront by the phenomenal performance by Ingrid Torelli as Lilly, a young woman with a demon inside of her. From the moment her face was on camera there was shiver down my spines. Dare I say it's as iconic as the girl in The Exorcist?The psychic, the sceptic, the scientist, the demon child and the man who thrives on better ratings, all familiar characters flung into one setting that digs to the core of all their motives. Does the psychic do it for money? Is the sceptic really that arrogant? Does the scientist mean well? Will Jack Delroy remain unpunished?These questions are answered swiftly as Lilly kills all but one, Jack Delroy. He brought the Devil on his show and he kills it too. I'd like to see how his career panned out after murdering a 13-year-old young woman on live TV.I only wish the film had delved into Delroy's involvement with the Grove as I feel that would've expanded the films scope and revealed what lengths Delroy was willing to go to to achieve fame. What exactly did he do in the ""tall tress""?It's ambiguous ending, although cut a little bit short, left me sat in my seat still wading through an ocean of tension and horror.

It always frustrates me when they are put in supernatural movies and made to look like they are the stupid one for not believing. 'Late Night with the Devil' was a well made and original movie that I think a lot of horror fans are going to really enjoy.The movie is technically found footage, however it never really feels like it because we are getting the professional camera angles the studio has set up for the majority of the film. There is a really well done narration sequence to begin the film that sets the scene. This gave me 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' vibes. Narration doesn't always work but when it's done well like this I have no problem with it.This film isn't about using cheap tricks like jump-scares. I may be wrong but I can't think of a single one in the film. Instead it creates a sense of dread. You know bad things are on the horizon and all you can do is sit back and watch them unfold.The thing I enjoyed most about this movie though was that nothing felt off limits. It clearly wasn't going to take the safe route, and because it is found footage, by definition it has to have a dark ending.

Was it worth it? Well the burgers were overpriced and lukewarm, but the cinema seats were comfy (I went for the luxury reclining option), and the film - thank heavens - lived up to the hype.With more than a dash of kitsch about it, Late Night with the Devil isn't particularly scary, but it is a remarkably fresh offering in a genre that has been frustratingly stale as of late. And while I never jumped out of my comfy seat, the whole thing did get under my skin with its unsettling premise - a live Halloween TV talk show that goes horribly wrong when the host dares to mess with the unknown, introducing guests who dabble in the occult.The film is smartly directed by Cameron and Colin Cairnes, who slowly build the eerie atmosphere and absolutely nail the 1970s aesthetic; the acting is excellent, with a standout performance by David Dastmalchian as the show's host Jack Delroy; and the climax is totally wild, delivering freaky moments of gory violence and a neat twist ending that proves that dealing with the devil never ends well.8/10.

"50","Late Night with the Devil","drownsoda90","8/10","25 March 2024","Presented as a documentary film, ""Late Night with the Devil"" focuses on Jack Delroy, an ambitious talkshow host who, after the death of his wife and a career downswing, attempts to revive his late-night show ""Night Owls"" with a Halloween 1977 special profiling the supernatural, particularly a young girl who is purportedly possessed. The unedited broadcast footage follows. Naturally, things do not go well.While ""Late Night with the Devil"" is largely made up of ingredients that genre fans are all too familiar with, the presentation here is really what makes the film tick--and that it does. The screenplay is an intelligent mashup of ""The Exorcist"" and ""Ghostwatch"" with a bit of the cutthroat TV careerist themes found in something like Sidney Lumet's ""Network"". It succeeds greatly at capturing the '70s kitschy late-night talkshow stylistics, furnishings, and general presentation. In moments, the set and cinematography resembles something akin to ""The Dick Cavett Show"". On a purely aesthetic level, the filmmakers really managed to capture the hazy, nostalgic fever dream feel of so many of the variety shows of that era.Plot-wise, it is further fleshed out by B-roll footage of the host, guests, and crew as they interact during commercial breaks. While at first I worried these breaks would detract from the live broadcast footage that makes up the bulk of the film, I can see why they were necessary in terms of actually making the plot function. The screenplay manages to build sufficient intrigue over the course of the show, as the origins of the possessed girl and the background of the host reach high occult peaks.In the vein of ""Ghostwatch"", things go truly bonkers in the last act, but the cast hold it all together nicely. David Dastmalchian is pitch perfect as the ambitious and appropriately hokey Delroy, and the supporting cast all hit their notes as they attempt to keep the show going despite mounting supernatural occurrences and chaos. The film explodes into a hallucinogenic finale that could nearly derail the understated buildup, but it comes out strong in the end in the sense that it leaves you pondering.While the gimmick of ""Late Night with the Devil"" is going to be the main draw for most, the film has more than enough spectacle, atmosphere, and a layered plot to help it rise above mere flimsy artifice. I envision it will have a long life playing on home televisions at many Halloween parties in the years to come. 8/10."," The show must go on"
"51","Kung Fu Panda 4","khelyorbek","6/10","22 March 2024","Would not recommend this to any of my friends or family. The movie felt like a cash grab with minimal effort. It felts like a modified plot from Movie 1 and re-used assets from following movies. I was expecting more for all the hype and ads they were pushing on all the platforms. The main character did nothing new or special and pretty much behaved exactly like you would expect him to behave. No character growth whatsoever. I think with Jack Black's retirement, the makes are trying to move the main role from being Panda to some other animal so they can keep milking the series forever. Its odd that the movie series is called ""Kung Fu Panda"" with an emphasis on ""Panda"" but now the dragon warrior will be someone completely different. VFX were good but the story is lackluster."," Movie 1 plot plus assets from 2 and 3"
"52","Kung Fu Panda 4","haggaihirbo","10/10","21 March 2024","To be honest, the callback of the previous villains was a really good idea. Also the villain being able to shape shift was not a bad idea. (Side note: Kung Fu Panda 3 was a 10/10,it was super funny all the way through and the fight scenes were incredible as well).But I lost interest in going to the theatre for kung fu panda 4 the moment I watched the trailer and saw that the FURIOUS FIVE won't be involved as much as in the previous kung fu panda films and instead replaced by a nobody fox!You cannot replace the FURIOUS FIVE who have featured in all the previous kung fu panda films and have been the backbone of the franchise with any others characters bro. That is just unacceptable. And for that, DreamWorks, you have lost my ticket!"," POOR CASTING"
"53","Kung Fu Panda 4","beaulewis-35620","5/10","31 March 2024","This is so far my most favorite of the kung fu panda franchise. But yet I am yet to see many people praise it, so I chose to do so!Most complaints I see are about the villain, not having a proper back story, and no furious 5, but I don't think people realise the furious 5 have never been the focus in Kung Fu PANDA, it's even in the title, and the enemies have never been good!Tai Long was only evil because, he got denied dragon warrior as Oogway saw darkness in him, but he would have never been evil in the first place, even this fourth film, proved that, with his final words to Po.Lord Shen was IMO the best, but his efforts was pointless by the third film, as they brang the pandas back.And also he was only evil due to a prophecy, which if he was never told he'd likely would never have been evil!!Kai I think was a decent villain tbf, no complaints whatsoever, but at the same time he wasn't very memorable!And now we have the Chameleon. Who grew up on the streets wanting to learn Kung Fu but couldn't because she was regarded as too small, let me just point out some things that proves she was a good villain, I know Mantis exists, but she grew up on the streets, in a city that didn't even know of the dragon warrior or the Furious 5, so in her city of course kung fu wouldn't be taught to her!And even so the focus was never for the enemy, it was for the new dragon warrior, who had a really good story I reckon, this fourth film is clearly to progress the story, to the next step!I really do think this was a good movie!"," I don't get the hate??"
"54","Kung Fu Panda 4","carlosdaniel-59536","6/10","4 April 2024","It's a fun film but far below the other previous films.The story is weak and so is the development, the villain has no charisma and was defeated very easily as she is the strongest villain in the entire saga. The lack of the other furious five left the plot boring and not interesting, most things in this film are unnecessary, despite having an interesting and well-developed new character.However, this is a film that you put on TV while you are doing other things in other rooms of your house, because it is difficult to stay immersed in the story.I'm being generous in giving 5/10, nostalgia won't let me give a lower rating."," Disappointing"

It was fun but it would be nice to see them challenge themselves a bit more. This movie was supposed to reinvigorate the franchise by choosing the next dragon warrior.

But out of no where the fox girl (Zhen) just appeared, telling Po about a random malevolent sorcerer that want to take over the world, and Po just, go and be the hero again? We saw Tai Lung, Kai, and Shen, they all had a connection to the main characters. And there's this Chameleon, not a single connection to Po or any other individuals that we already knew, and Po just... be the hero and go on fighting that girl? It was TOO rushed, it felt weird.Secondly, i feel like the moral lesson and the story was not handled well. How could Po realize that he had to change his mindset by just, fighting a shapeshifting sorcerer, and just somehow chose Zhen to be the successor? I really had a lot of expectation for the potentials of the shapeshifting power. But instead, i got rip-off versions of the Kung fu masters, and a... dragon? Like you literally can absorb powers and transform different parts of your body, and she chose to be a dragon and just flying around? That was literally so stupid and absurd, how can you even think of taking the world when you can't even use your powers right? And then Zhen somehow could use the spiritual power, and boom, she was chosen to be the successor, after her betrayal and stuffs? And i still couldn't find a change in Po to be capable for guarding the Spirit Realm.But hey, besides these problems, overall the animation is still awesome, still really funny and not cringey, i did laugh a lot, so yeah, it's totally fine."," Acceptable, i guess."

I found the transition leading to the introduction of the new dragon warrior, Zhen, to be both lucid and humorous.The animation and special effects left a strong impression on me. In my opinion, they delivered a refreshing departure from the conventional animation styles, particularly during the action sequences.However, the film's conclusion was its weak point. The buildup to the climax felt somewhat underwhelming. Despite the premise of the antagonist absorbing all the kung fu moves from various masters and heroes, their defeat came too swiftly. I anticipated more intense fight scenes demonstrating the antagonist's formidable power.In summary: I rate it a 7.5 overall!"," Enjoyed it !"
"61","Kung Fu Panda 4","asepsenso","7/10","30 March 2024","When Kung Fu Panda (2008) first appeared, the audience was presented with new characters with a fresh, fun story. Panda, which is usually synonymous with adorable animals, is packaged as a kung fu expert with his adventures in finding his identity.The success of the first film made Kung Fu Panda a successful Dreamworks franchise, resulting in a television series and a fourth film, Kung Fu Panda 4 (2024), which began showing in Indonesian cinemas this week. Even though it tries to use the same moves as the previous films, Kung Fu Panda 4 feels like it has reached its saturation point, although it still manages to entertain the audience with action packed with laughter.Kung Fu Panda 4 returns with its main character, Po (Jack Black), who has now become a respected and famous Dragon Warrior in the Valley of Peace. His peace was disturbed when Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) told him it was time to give up the role of Dragon Warrior and become a Spiritual Leader, following in the footsteps of the previous Master Oogway.However, Po, who still loved his status as a warrior, rejected that idea. The intrigue begins when a new threat appears in the form of Chameleon (Viola Davis), a shape-shifting chameleon witch who targets the power of Po's enemies in the spirit world.To face this threat, Po must choose a successor to the Dragon Warrior and unite with Zhen (Awkwafina), a clever ninja fox. Even though several moments of kung fu action and Po's typical jokes are shown again, the whole film seems to have lost the momentum that once made this franchise a success.Po's lack of significant character development also makes Kung Fu Panda 4 feel less meaningful. Po, who previously had found his identity and overcome various obstacles, is now trapped in a storyline that feels generic and without meaning.This film feels more like an episode of a television series than an epic journey that we are used to enjoying on the big screen. The absence of the Furious Five characters, who were previously an element to enhance the kung fu action, leaves Jack Black and Awkwafina as if they were trying to do a stand up comedy duo throughout the film.The interactions between Po and Zhen inject humor and provide a unique perspective of heroic dynamics. Both are able to balance humor for children and adults.Director Mike Mitchell lacks the epic touch and intense action that is the hallmark of the Kung Fu Panda franchise . Even so, Kung Fu Panda 4 still entertains the audience. Its improved visuals and new environments introduced, especially in Juniper City, provide refreshing variety.The innovative animated action scenes and interesting character designs continue to provide entertainment, especially for young viewers who have not previously followed this film. The presence of several previous voice actors, such as Dustin Hoffman, Bryan Cranston, and James Hong, to Ian McShane also brings its own nostalgia for loyal fans of the franchise.Overall, Kung Fu Panda 4 still provides humor and entertaining kung fu action. Even so, this 92 minute film fails to match the glory of its predecessor, especially the first film which so far still feels like the best of the four films."," Kung Fu Panda 4 Film Review, Closing Action Full of Meaningless Laughter"
"62","Kung Fu Panda 4","malekalnajafi","7/10","10 March 2024","Just watched Kung Fu panda 4.And what can I say except I'm disappointed. It's the worst out of the franchise. It's feels like an episode like the villain got all the villains powers then she dies from 2 flicks from the staff that Po is using. And then all the villains bow to po at the end. So dumb.And why is Po picking a new dragon warrior when the dragon warrior prophecy has been a 200 year old prophecy.2nd of all oogway picked Po because he resembles the yin and yang this fox is so random. Like all the villans in the kung Fu panda are cool and all have a motive. Tai lung was lied to and wanted to be the dragon warrior. Lord shen wanted to rule all of China and sad origin story of Po past and general kai felt betrayed by oogway and wanted revenge and no one knew his name, even though general kai treated him as a brother also awesome theme andnow chameleon idk what she wants but it sounds like she wants to rule all of China like Lord Chen.I also felt like Kung Fu panda 4 was a cheap rip off of kung Fu panda 2 of how they explore different parts of China and Both the chameleon and lord Chen have the same motivesOverall 7/10 being niceI'm not saying it's a bad movie but all Kung Fu panda movies were a masterpiece so this was VERY disappointing."," Meh 😕 7/10"
"63","Kung Fu Panda 4","csxtnf","5/10","8 March 2024","I've been a fan of this franchise for a very long time and what I've got to say for the 4th movie it's not that bad it's still a good movie even with its flaws, I do like the idea of Po becoming a spiritual leader and trying to find the next dragon warrior, in my opinion I think this is a good start for this new trilogy I don't think it's a cash grabbed because they have already been planning 6 Kung fu panda movies here are my pros and cons for this 4th installmentProsThe idea of bringing past villains back especially Tai Lung, Lord Shen and General Kai is a good idea.In my opinion I think the chameleon is a better villain than Kai and Viola Davis played the chameleon so perfectly.At first I was worried but I think Awkwafina done so much better for this role as Zhen I also like the backstory they gave zhen.I'm so glad they brought tai lung back and finally gave him a redemption arc even though I kinda wish we have more for his redemption but I think it's good the way it is and I like the fact that he respected and bow to po at the end.The fight scenes were awesome they were short but awesome and an improvement.Po's dads have a bigger role in this film and I think they were really funny and great in this film.The animation was really good even though I would have preferred the realistic animation but the animation is still good and its really amazing in some scenes.I don't think the soundtrack was that bad as people say I personally like it especially at the end credit scene when jack black sings Baby one more time.ConsI am glad they brought back Shen and Kai but they play a very small role like a 30 second cameo and they don't have any lines at all it sucks that they didn't bring back the voice actors.I wish they gave more dept for The Chameleon all their really was is that they didn't accept her to learn Kung fu because she was small so she gave up that path to learn how to become a sorcerer.The furious five only makes a cameo, in the beginning po explains that their off to an adventure on their own then they appear at the end of the credits training with Zhen.I would like to point out of how Kai is somehow brought back, in the 3rd film he exploded for taking to much chi in the spirit realm and shouldn't he not really exit no more? I wish they could have explained how he came back.I do like the ending but it doesn't make sense, so not only tai lung bowed and respect po but also Kai and shen and other master bowed and respected po I also wish they would have explain why Kai and shen bowed and respect po, Maybe because po saved them and got their Kung fu back? Probably but i wish they could have gotten more into detail of why Kai and shen have respect for po now.Those were my pros and cons so I don't think this movie was bad I think it's still good and a good way to start this new trilogy so I'm giving this 4th film a 7.5/10."," It's not that bad it's still a good movie"
"64","Kung Fu Panda 4","happypowercat","7/10","20 March 2024","I really found this movie disappointing. I have always been a huge fan of the Kung Fu Panda series. For me, Po is the absolute star every time he returns, but it's their past villains that really stick with me. The new villain is an interesting character, but she doesn't have enough background information to resonate with the audience and keeps making illogical decisions. There's no real climax, as the theme is vague and it feels like little more than entertainment. The stereotype structure is clearly laid out before the audience (becoming hero-lesson). DreamWorks tries so hard to maintain this structure that it feels like they don't care about how the audience actually feels. They had all the pieces, but the pieces didn't come together in the right way to tell the right story. The animation is okay, and some of the lines are funny and meaningful as usual, but everything feels too contrived. A good family movie for kids, Po is entertaining as usual.

"65","Kung Fu Panda 4","devanparker-71888","8/10","21 March 2024","My review's title, in my opinion, sums everything up. If I had to use one word to sum up the movie, it would just be ""passable."" My children, ages six and seven, enjoyed it when I laughed a few times. Ultimately, I suppose that was a wise use of the funds. Having said that, I love a lot of DreamWorks properties, such as the first three KFP movies, the third of which is a fun watch but not as wonderful as the others. The third movie is a masterpiece in contrast to KP4, which didn't really offer much to the franchise. KP4's humor and tempo struck me as being all over the place. The movie seemed to be hurrying the audience along.Ultimately, I'm happy my kids enjoyed it because I will quickly forget everything about this film. Scenes from KFP 2-such as Po discovering inner peace among the destruction of his village-come to mind whenever I think of KFP. The humor in the first three movies will always make me laugh, but even now, barely an hour after watching KFP4, I can't even think of the best gags in the movie. The movie's tribute to past villains is its greatest and most memorable feature. Aside from that, it was just one big, vibrant, frantic ""Meh."""," I always love this movie."
"66","Kung Fu Panda 4","elochoap","7/10","22 March 2024","I don't know any person who hates the kung fu panda's trilogy, but that can change until the 4th movie. I say it because I can qualify the movie as disappointing, principally for the script and the behaviors of the characters. The characters feels like other totally different about the past movies. For example, Lee, the Po's dad, in the others movies seens like a furious and brave panda, but in this movie, he seens more like a fearful and afraid panda, that it's not totally bad, because not always we have to seem as a brave persons, that shows the other part of the personality of the character.But in my opinion, in despite of that, the movie was really good, principally in the aspects of animation, I consider that was very fluid, and the development of the scenes of the two dads of Po were compelling, they made me remember the feelings of a dad for his son, and admire they too much. If I will need to compare the movie to another that I have seen, I will say that is as good as ""shrek 3"", because definitely isn't the best from the saga, but neither is as bad as many people says."," The good and bad apects about the last Kung fu panda's movie."

But if (SPOILERS) they need more ideas for next one they should have one of the villains/etc from the spirit world didn't return back or a villain who strikes real fear (illustrating change can be bad) and maybe not even related to kung fu.

Jack Black did a wonderful job fulfilling his role as Po, and captured his character perfectly.There are just so many scenes I could pick as my favourite so I would like to share a few. Spoiler alert!I found myself with my jaw on the floor when Po revealed the strength of the staff of wisdom, and called out his signature phrase, ""Skadoosh!""I also loved the part of the film where Master Shifu met his unfortunate end after a deadly strike from The Chameleon. Po's rage and will to avenge his former master shows us how much he truly appreciates what he has done for him. I genuinely shed a tear, first for my sadness, and then later for my happiness. When Shifu returned from the dead and unleashed his final attack, I was just as shocked as the characters in the movie.Another thrilling scene has definitely got to be when we were all fooled into thinking Po has been killed. I was in disbelief, until his made his return and slaughtered The Chameleon and her army. I was a little shocked to say the least, but it's not something unusual for our kung fu panda friend.Finally, I was filled with so many emotions when I learned that the fox betrayed Po. We all trusted her, but thankfully she redeemed herself when she proved that she was no longer allowing herself to be used by The Chameleon.Overall, it was just perfect. It may be advertised as a children's movie, but I think that everybody needs to watch it. I am certain when I say that this is one hundred percent, my most favourite movie."," Amazing film!"

I think the return of the legendary five to the palace at the end of the film is a sign that they will be in the next film. It was an average film compared to the first three films. I also felt that there were deficiencies in the film. It was not as full as the other films. Both the new character and the chameleon were not handled well enough. Especially the chameleon.

"75","Kung Fu Panda 4","javierja",NA,"4 April 2024","I read a lot of people complaining about the bad quality of the jokes or the little amount of them in this film. That might be true, but, that doesn't make it a bad film. As all the Kung Fu panda films, this one is also full of little dialogues that make you think about life, always trying to include the Chinese wisdom in a very easy way to understand and apply (even for the kids). In my opinion, that has much more value in a film than just some vain jokes. In this movie, Po has to understand that changes are good and common, not easy to accept but that's part of the life and sometimes we just need to move on in our life and share our knowledge and experience with others.A movie for kids doesn't that it has to be full of silly situations and laughs all the time.

"76","Kung Fu Panda 4","chenp-54708","3/10","2 March 2024","Man, I really wanted to love this one.The Kung Fu Panda franchise is interesting because I really love the first two Kung Fu Panda movies as the stories, characters and thrills were really great. I found the characters to be engaging and are some of Dreamworks best movies. However, I thought the third one was okay and I have never seen the television series so I can't comment on that. With this sequel coming out after some time, there are some good aspects I like but even though I knew it might not be perfect, I still was left underwhelmed.Think of Kung Fu Panda 4 like this. You hired writers who create new ideas and concepts that could have been good but ends up being uneven and at times, uninteresting. Write a story that lacks the uniqueness and charm of what made the previous ones amazing. Have new but uninteresting and annoying characters be given screen time and be provided with some really annoying voice performances. Explore some really really good concepts but not utilizing them well. Hire the filmmaker who is known for making Shrek Forever After, Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked be in control. Then, bringing back previous characters that were beloved, yet felt more like nostalgia bait. That is Kung Fu Panda 4 for you.It is simply really disappointing because the animation, designs, musical score, and Jack Black's performance are really good. Many of the animation models, colors and designs are unique and the voice performances from Jack Black and some of the other cast members are pretty good. Alongside with some of the fight and action sequences that are pretty well done, especially the scene where Po and shapeshifter Po were fighting which had some great visuals and editing.It's obvious there is talent and passion behind this movie but the uninteresting narrative and missing charm and energy really fails to make it good. The humor isn't strong and the characters, while the character of PO is still fun, the new characters and the villain were really uninteresting, annoying and lacked chemistry. Alongside provided with some bad dialogue which made it difficult to really believe a single word from them.Some of the lighting and presentation feels cheap, the direction is odd, the atmosphere is solid, and some of the pacing moments were a bit uneven.I might sound cynical but I really wanted to like this one since I adore the first two Kung Fu Panda movies, but this was disappointing. I was hoping to be surprised like how Puss in Boot: The Last Wish did. But it didn't happen. Overall, it's not terrible and there are some strong moments that I did like. But this shows the golden age of this franchise is no longer the same.EDIT: Having found out about the behind the scenes of the production, what a shame."," Unfortunately, it was REALLY underwhelming."
"77","Kung Fu Panda 4","candyyt-05311","6/10","9 March 2024","Have you ever watched a movie and felt so underwhelmed right from the start? Well, that's exactly how I felt when I watched this one. The beginning was a drag, with Shifu telling Po that he needed to pass on his Dragon Warrior title to someone else. Not exactly the most exciting plot point to kick off a movie, right? And the way it ended just felt rushed.To make matters worse, the fight scenes were disappointingly short, and Po hardly got to showcase his abilities. I was left wondering why the filmmakers didn't utilize his skills more. And what's up with Tai Lung's sudden decision to go back to the spirit realm? It just felt so unearned, especially since the film barely focused on him. And don't even get me started on Kai and Shen, who didn't even get to speak!But it's not all bad news. The animation in the movie is simply stunning, and the new city looks gorgeous. And while Po's abilities may not have been used to their full potential, the fight scenes still managed to look decent. I have to admit, I did get invested when Po was betrayed by Zhen. It left me feeling shocked and kept me engaged until the end.While I didn't miss the Furious Five, who were absent from this movie, it's hard to ignore the fact that certain aspects of the plot just don't make sense. Overall, if you're willing to lower your expectations, you might find the movie okay, but you might end up feeling disappointed so this is a decent movie."," I'm sorry I really wanted to love this"
"78","Kung Fu Panda 4","emwilliams-02657","6/10","8 March 2024","I think the title of my review says it all. If I had to come up with a word to describe the film, it would merely be, ""passable."" I chuckled a couple of times and my kids (6 & 7) loved it. At the end of the day, I suppose that's money well spent. That being said, I am a huge fan of many DreamWorks franchises, including the first 3 KFP films, with the 3rd installment being the weakest of them, but still a good time. Compared to KP4, which didn't really add anything to the franchise, the 3rd film is a masterpiece. I found the pacing and the humor of KP4 all over the map. It felt like the film was rushing the audience along without time to really feel any of the emotions it wanted us to feel. It felt like a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a memorable addition to the KFP film canon.So, in the end, I'm glad my kids loved it because I am promptly going to forget everything about this movie. When I think of KFP, scenes like Po finding inner peace in the ruins of his village in KFP 2 will always readily come to mind. I will continue to laugh at the jokes in the first 3 films, but even now I'm struggling to recall the best jokes of KFP4 and I just saw it not even an hour ago. The best, most enduring part of this movie is callback to villains of the previous films. Otherwise, it was one big colorful, fast-paced ""Meh.""The kids will enjoy it though."," Not awful, but certainly not good"
"79","Kung Fu Panda 4","bololsyahputra","5/10","6 March 2024","As someone who love the trilogy, this movie is much more worse than those third, so let me tell my opinion as a fan of the older trilogy.This movie is a huge step down from the trilogy, at least in the third movie the villain built around Oogway's past and even though kinda made up at least this villain has a background to attack and destroy jade palace. But this movie has villain that just ""I am powerful shapeshifter i will conquer China"", She doesn't has complicated story like lord shen that makes me don't feel the same emotion and empathy as i had with Shen.The story is kinda weird tbh, like new dragon warrior? And more when Po actually choose someone who is a former wanted criminal rather than one of furious five. The story is really expectable though.The new character Zhen has really poor character development making me ask a lot like how is she turned against her master, like there are no scene of heavy emotion that makes her turn.And the obvious one that i don't like about this is how dare they don't including furious five in Po's adventure? I'd really like to see them caught and how silly Po actually save them. They don't even make shen and kai speak at least a word.With those weak and bad point i don't think this movie is really worth to watch, you can pretend that the story ended in third one. And like i said in the title they could make Zhen more loving character, the furious five should be there, the villain have to have more reason to conquer China and more character (there are literally only 10 casts in the credit scene)."," Even though it's an obvious cash grab, it could have been better"
"80","Kung Fu Panda 4","josenaruto-53442","5/10","10 March 2024","Man, this movie was a huge waste of time. It's basically Cars 3 with the previous movies. All of it was predictable, and not in a good way.In Puss In Boots 2 for example (I'm using it because is the last good movie DreamWorks has done) you could see where the plot was going, but the characters and jokes made is really enjoyable. In this one, I disliked every new character and the treatment to the old ones.Po doesn't know if he is good with martial arts or if he is a newbie that anyone can beat.Zhen is the cliche of evil character and ends up being bad and worked for the villain but she liked Po so now she is good, and somehow ended up as the Dragon Warrior just because.The Furious 5 have not a single line of dialogue in the movie, they apear a few seconds at the beggining and at the end, doing nothing for the plot.The precious villains were massacred in here, specially Shen since he appears and does nothing at all, not a line, not a reaction, nothing. Tai Lung spoke and reacted but it was really unnecesary, Kai was the same as Shen, but him being an enemy of Oogway.and not one of Po made this kinda understandable.Basically, this movie didn't need to happen, but DreamWorks is compiting with Disney to see who destroys their loved franchices better, first Megamind and now this. Gotta give it to them tho, this one is WAY better than Megamind 2, but still bad compared to even the third one."," Unnecesary"
"81","Kung Fu Panda 4","kevin_robbins","6/10","10 March 2024","My wife and I caught Kung Fu Panda 4 (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline introduces a new villain, a chameleon with shape-shifting abilities, aiming to take over the world. The chameleon seeks to use the staff Po received in Kung Fu Panda 3 to open a gateway to another dimension, summon kung fu masters, and steal their powers to become unstoppable. Simultaneously, Po must find his replacement to train as the next Dragon Warrior. Can Po save the world and find his apprentice simultaneously?Co-directed by Mike Mitchell (Trolls) and Stephanie Stine (Major Motion Picture debut), the film features the voices of Jack Black (School of Rock), Viola Davis (The Help), Awkwafina (Crazy, Rich, Asians), Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie), James Hong (Big Trouble in Little China), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), and Ke Huy Quan (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom).The animation, animal universe, and the introduction of the new villain were excellent, as always. Viola Davis was a great addition, but Awkwafina's presence felt awkward and annoying. The absence of the Furious Five was noticeable, and the two-father subplot was just okay. The film strikes a good balance between lessons and comedy, and kept us laughing throughout. While the ending was rewarding, it didn't quite match the brilliance of previous films in the series.In conclusion, Kung Fu Panda 4 offers a fun, above-average animated experience but stands as the weakest link in the series. I'd score it a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once."," Kung Fu Panda 4 offers a fun, above-average animated experience but stands as the weakest link in the series"
"82","Kung Fu Panda 4","BigDaddy4000","6/10","12 March 2024","You can REALLY feel the writers and actors strike with this one. It wasnt *terrible,* but it was just really lame and a major step down from all the previous KFP movies. Yes, even the third one. Not as much of a step down as megamind 2 mind you, but its definitely there. Firstly they ditched a lot of the voice actors from the original series, and so what they did was they either shoehorned them out of the story with some lame excuse, or just not gave them lines and just had them appear silent. The emotional depth is there, but again, its just a step down from what we've grown to expect from kung fu panda. The movie has a lot of filler and pointless subplots, po is reduced to a whiny baby in the first 10 minutes of the movie, the pacing is off, and the villain, OH MAN the villain was weak. Again, not the worst thing in the world, but her motives were purely contradictory from things that were established in the movies universe, shes never portrayed as a real threat. (remember back in KFP 2 when it was stated that lord shen literally killed a king fu master early on? The worst thing the chameleon does in this movie is push a guy down a flight of stairs. Oh no.)
the action was there i guess, it had some creative and somewhat exciting action scenes, the animation was pretty good overall, especially with the chameleons morphs (Probably just because there isnt an ""animators strike"" going on as well)
its definitely kung fu panda, but it just feels like they forgot a couple ingredients for the stew, so to speak. It just ended up being a step down from what we were expecting. Not terrible, just disappointing."," just underwhelming"
"83","Kung Fu Panda 4","rgkarim","8/10","8 March 2024","LIKES:Great Animation
-DreamWorks has created another fantastic world filled with stunning design and animation.-Fluid movement combined with great animation makes a fantastic place to enjoy the adventure, loaded to the nines with that same splendor found in Kung Fu Panda.-The animals hold so much personality, which when mixed with the gorgeous setting, creates a vivid world that is pleasing to the eyes, especially in 3-D.Strong Voice Acting
-A fabulous cast comes together to bring the animals to life in ways that create engaging characters.-Jack Black is the martial arts mammal and is still as ridiculous as ever with his clumsy, goofy, and naïve self that continues to melt our hearts. Somehow, he still gives some heart to his performance to bring out the deeper levels of Po's character development.-Awkwafina is a newcomer to the game and brings that sass and attitude to the fox character, Zhen. A great personification of the actress, she's a welcome addition to the world, with her humor fitting well into the animal antics.-And Davis rounds out the acting with a solid performance. The chameleon has a poignant prose, and her status is well-matched to Davis' strong demeanor, deep, icy voice, and threatening attitude that the actress carries well.Funny At Many Parts
-If you are a fan of Kung Fu Panda humor, chances are you will find enjoyment in the fourth installment.-Po's adventure is loaded with quirky dialog that is innocent and jovial. His naivety is charming to watch, but I like how Po engages with the cavalcade of characters who spice up the antics.-His dads come along for the ride as well, forming a fun substory that held its charm and cuteness. The little intermissions from the story helped keep the humor fresh and blended nicely to the ending without going too far out of the way to accomplish it.-Altogether, the movie accomplished much in this department and stuck to its roots for simplistic chuckles and laughs.Deep Story Components
-Despite being a kid's film, Kung Fu Panda 4 still manages to give some deeper plot elements that were very relevant to me.-Po's journey keeps evolving with each film, requiring the clumsy oaf to face the changes life throws at him and take the lessons to heart.-It did not matter with whom he engaged. Po somehow manages to find those vulnerabilities and engage them in a manner that feels legitimate and authentic.-This helps reign in the movie from becoming too comedic and helps viewers invest a bit more into the film and complete this journey with the panda.Entertaining End Credits
-The first half of the credits gives you more animated goodness with our characters and brings some nostalgia that I quite enjoyed.-A cover by the lead actor's band accompanies the scenes and provides a solid track that matches the theme of the sequence.-Surprisingly, the song is also quite a good cover with comedy and rock beautifully combining into an engaging and energetic track.Cute And Balanced
-The movie accomplishes much in being an entertaining film for all ages to enjoy.-One level is the heavy emphasis on silly antics, laughable clumsiness, and the censorship that cushions the violet components of the movie.-Yet, Kung Fu Panda 4 is not pulling punches either. The movie provides plenty of inside jokes and elements for parents and older members to enjoy that helps expand who will enjoy the movie.-Such a balance is what I loved in nineties movies and this film felt in touch with that balance.Action That Works Super Well
-Surprisingly, I really loved the action of this film and found it to be one of the better sequences I've seen in a while.-The animation is a solid display of computer-generated imagery, with strong attention to detail to display the martial arts in an accurate manner.-Dynamic fight sequences unleash the tension of the moment and hold anime level quality of fast punches, wicked reversals, and physics defying finishers. All with that magical twist representative of the lore.DISLIKES:More Of The Same
-It's a great movie, but the fourth installment still is more of the same design and function as the others.-While the base is important, I would have enjoyed the movie adding that twist and edge that the first two movies held.-Or at least reintegrate the other characters a little better to help give a bit more climactic suspense into the movie and elevate the movie's inclusion of many new characters.A Rushed Finale
-Another instance of timing issues, this film still struggled to perfect the final battle and finish.-Po's part they knocked out of the park, which was the saving grace of the movie. While the planning, character speeches and last-minute solutions were the weaker elements that needed another ten to fifteen minutes to make it worthwhile.-Even the touching speech at the end felt a tad drowned out by the quick wrap up, only saved by the transition to the fun credits and the promise something more could still come from this film.Predictable
-No surprises here. King Fu Panda Four doesn't add too many twists or surprises that I could not predict early on in the film.-There isn't much more I can say. So don't expect any mind-blowing moments, but in a way it doesn't matter.Tries A Tad Hard To Be Funny
-And like always, Jack Black and the crew sometimes try a bit too hard to get a rise out of you.-Some lines are a tad over-emphasized, a little too much push to get the line out and get you to laugh.-Other running jokes become stale or annoying, never knowing when to quit. I suspect such antics will be enjoyed by kids, but viewers like me might just roll their eyes at the constant reiteration.The VERIDCT:
Kung Fu Panda's latest installment may not be the most unique experience I have had, but it certainly is one of the more fun movies I've gotten this year. Sticking to its roots, Po's story continues to be a fun adventure filled with family-friendly laughs and balanced storytelling for all ages to enjoy. Beautiful design and animation make the world come to life and strong voice acting helps to further develop the characters we've grown to love. And with action that is very fitting and perhaps some of the better fights I've seen in a long time, the movie accomplishes much in a shorter run time. Sure, a few twists could have broken up the monotony alongside better character usage. A less rushed ending also would have helped this movie end on the strongest foot it could with that wisdom meets humor, but the entertaining credits are a blessing. With everything incorporated, I give this movie:Animation/Action/Adventure: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.5."," Kung Fun Panda"

Comedy is getting worse and worse; even if I prefer the humor of the first two movies, the third managed to get some laughs out of me, this one didn't. I wish the directors understood that what made the first two films successful was how deep the story was and how well the characters were developed, something that was lost in this one. Yes, it's a movie for kids, but the previous ones were also and they still managed to touch on dark themes and be enjoyable for adults; I'm currently 22 years old and I never got tired of watching Kung Fu Panda 2, laughing, crying and getting emotional like when I was 11.

They exchanged the furious five for a new character, with a pixarish design that doesn't fit into the universe at all. Some of the more important events to the overall story of Kung Fu panda like Tai Lung's ,, retribution"" were glanced over which was a complete joke and made no sense. Also all of the villain's just coming back into the spirit realm without fighting back was really out of character. Everything was cartoonified, even the models of e.g lord Shen. The writers didn't seem to care about the previous movies and just stomped all over the Kung Fu panda legacy. The series was perfect as a trilogy and definitely didn't need another movie, but they just had to milk it, pitiful.This conludes my rant, I may have been to harsh because the movie wasn't really bad per se, it just wasnt kung fu panda level.

They could have done it like Megamind 2, to have the film only for streaming platforms because it is quite mid, but we are talking about Kung Fu Panda which is famous and has a wide audience and fans, which is why they cleverly used this film as a big cash grab. So we were manipulated with Tai Lung, who had 4 sentences and so much of him, I thought he would have more importance in the story. And as for the other villains, they haven't spoken a single word, like a Chameleon had got there tongues, they were totally cheap on the budget and even eliminated the furious five because you have to give money to the actors, right? As far as the film is concerned, it is nothing special, it had a few good jokes, very powerful sentences and that's it, it had a fair lesson but it is not as dominant as the previous trilogy. Plotwist surprised me for real, and also this movie didn't surprise me as a total failure.

The villain is so completely underdeveloped, with no real backstory, no coherent motive- the writers couldn't even bother to give her a name. Most importantly however, nothing of importance happens in this movie. There is zero growth or change, and the characters you have come to love in this franchise don't even make any important impact on the plot.

They could have made the main villain more influential like Tai lung or Shen.Po is quite young to pass the torch and atleast they he should have a big moment before he could agree on doing it.

What I was shocked about was that there are is a large amount of great things and flawsThe animation looks wonderful and there was some stunning shots here and there but the character designs for the new characters don't look stunning at all. Zhen looks like she belongs to a whole different franchise and rest of the new cast looks like they came straight out of an animated seriesThe story/plot although had the potential to be as great as the first 2, was still quite decent. I was eerie of Zhen at first but you know I liked her but Tai Lung probably would have been a better candidate for dragon warrior, speaking of whichIt was a nice touch to see how much he has changed. From the anger driven vengeful psycho in the first to a much more relaxed character here. However once again him taking a bigger role would've also been a big potential. Also a changed Shen would've been a bonus and fulfill the fans of Kung Fu Panda 2Have you noticed every good thing I said all had a better alternative? That's because this film sort of wasted its potential. In fact it had more potential than the 3rd but they literally rushed the film so much to the point Chameleon has no backstory. An extra 20 minutes of depth probably would've shot it up to a 9/10. Like DreamWorks chill outHowever one thing they did managed to get right was the beautifully animated action scenes. 2 and 3 definitely were more focused on character dramas and conflicts rather than fights. So this film plays tribute to the original by having a lot of action sequences that are all eye-watering to seeIf you came just to see some kung fu action, then go watch and you'll most likely enjoy it. However for average film enjoyers this film surprisingly has onslaughts of flawsThe new characters especially the thieves were completely pointless yet they still take up screen time. Most importantly of all where is the furious 5? Another Po+ Furious 5 journey would've made it too similar to 2 but at least give them like 5 minutes of screen time. Also why did they completely scrap Mr. Ping's character development in the 2&3films because he is even more overprotective. At least he didn't go after Po in Kung Fu Panda 2 unlike what he did hereI kind of found the humor in the first act very infuriating but Li steals the show from the 2nd act because any comedic scene with him is just hilarious.

For the first time in almost a decade, comedy icon Jack Black returns to his role as Po, the world's acknowledged most unlikely kung fu master. Some familiar characters are here to support him on his journey along with some new relationships which refresh this beloved franchise.Po, the Dragon Warrior (Jack Black) is about to experience a transition in his kung fu role in the Valley of Peace. Kung Fu Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) informs Po that he is needed to become a spiritual leader and to choose and train the next Dragon Warrior. This new role is a challenge for Po as he enjoys butt-kicking moves to counter villains and questions his fitness for a new cerebral role. While searching for inner peace we are reminded that for Po everything comes back to dumplings. Resisting his new role, Po determines it is necessary to first thwart a powerful new sorceress, Chameleon (Viola Davis), who can shapeshift and seeks total kung fu domination. He finds an unlikely partner in a tricky thief, Zhen (Awkwafina) who ends up teaching him that heroes can be found even in a den of thieves.The computer animation of this film is so beautiful that, in the beginning, it almost appears to be 3D. The backgrounds are stunning and you'll love the various scenes in this wonton wonderland from DreamWorks Animation. I really enjoyed the interaction between the unlikely duo of Po and Zhen and the comedy created between their two characters. I absolutely love the new villain Chameleon and Viola Davis really illustrates how small and stylish stature doesn't impact the extent of evil evident in a character.This film's message is that true change comes from within and that support from family and friends makes a great impact while helping to enable that change. After all, every step someone takes, no matter how large or small creates a footprint for others to follow.Kung Fu Panda 4 gets 5 out of 5 stars from me and I recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults.

When I say lame myb10 year said this..
Some of the new cast is really not great with voice overs as you hear they get out of character a few times. No joke here.So the plot itself is not too bad, but its so stretched, almost 20 mins too long. The painful part is about 45mins where you start looking the time and realizing there is still another 30mins.Beginning is funny and fast
The end is terrific.For my I rather have waited for the at home experienceA solid 5Hopefully this one ends the franchise."," After nearly 9 years I thought there would be more"
"99","Kung Fu Panda 4","fantrailersforfans","8/10","4 March 2024","I had a lot of skepticism for this movie. I didn't like the trailers they put out and i think Kung Fu Panda 3 was a very satisfying conclusion to the story. But wow was i suprised. Kung Fu Panda 4 is a very good movie, that is abseloutly worth checking out.The absence of the Furious Five is not as big of a blow as i thought it would be, and you actually don't really miss them, and it makes sence for them not to be there. The story does feel a bit to similar to Kung Fu Panda 2, and the music, no disrespect to Hans Zimmer, is a lot of the old, not really any new cool score. But when the original score hits, it hits hard! The fight choreography is amazing, the action scenes are beautiful and inventive. The movie is funny and full of heart. Our villain is cool and menacing, but not as iconic as our first three villains. Our new co-lead, Zhen, is a lot of fun and a good companion to Po. It was also amazing to see former villains return. Po's two fathers had suprisingly much screentime, which was a lot of fun. What holds this movie a bit back is the lack of deepness. The first three movies tackled some deep and complex themes, and i missed that in this movie. But it made me excited for potential upcomming Kung Fu Panda movies."," A worthy start to a new chapter for the Dragon Warrior"
"100","Kung Fu Panda 4","modzelm-19176","6/10","9 March 2024","I went to see this at the theaters day one and it was kind of disappointing to me.What i don't like: Characters and story were very predictable and basic. No funny humor for kids or adults. No emotional moments like the trilogy had.What i like: Like always the animation, voice acting, and score was good as to be expected. It was cool to see tai lung and the other Villans back.Overall, it's not a bad movie but not as good as the first and second. It could have been much better but its mediocre. It really should've stayed as a trilogy. I more recommend the Og trilogy over this movie as a Og growing up watching the first."," a disapointment"
"101","The Gentlemen","jovcicnino","8/10","16 February 2020","Didn't go into this movie expecting much. My first thought was that it is a cliché action movie with a predictable plot. Turns out it's not. The narrating is amazing, Hugh Grant kills the role and does an amazing job at narrating the story. I've always had a bad view of implementing random comedic bits in a thriller action movies, but in this one it felt refreshing and in place."," An exciting watch."
"102","The Gentlemen","stefanmiluszusky","8/10","24 January 2020","A fun night at the movies awaits!
Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) is looking to get out of his drug empire, so he's looking to sell it off. What we get, though, is a whole lot of chaos and laughs along the way.Today is January 23rd, so when I went to see this movie I wasn't expecting a good movie. January movies are full of garbage a lot of the time, so I thought this could be next line of filth that Hollywood wanted to give us at this time of year, but this is not what happened.""The movie was actually GREAT""Guy Ritchie, the writer and director of the film, is most known for ""Snatch"", which is also a movie that involves a ton of chaos and laughs, and ""The Gentlemen"" is much of the same. If I had to describe this movie in one sentence it would be as follows:""It's what 'Knives Out' wanted to be.""""Knives Out"" came out last year and many people enjoyed it. It was a ""who done it"" film with a ton of self aware comedy and plenty of action but, to me, the comedy didn't quite stick the way Rian Johnson wanted it to, but ""The Gentlemen's"" humor does stick with us in this film. And yes, there is plenty of mystery to go around in the film, which makes the action sequences and the dry British humor that much better.When we think Guy Ritchie, we think of humor but something that might be overlooked is the style of his movies. They are stylistic. It might come as a surprise that dry British humor can also have a sort of artistic style to go with it but it can. From the closeups to the quick cut action shots, Guy Ritchie delivers and he delivers this same style to ""The Gentlemen.""Is there an acting performance that stands out from this movie? No, I don't think one actor steals the show or carries it. The whole cast does a good job at teaming up to make this a fun, comedic, action filled movie. Though, I will say, Hugh Grant is quite good in his scenes and so is Colin Farrell. Much of the same could be said about Charlie Hunnam, who I'm not the most familiar with.This wasn't your average January movie, and could have definitely been a Summer movie if the studios so wished to do so. If you liked ""Snatch"" you will love this movie a ton, but even if you didn't I would still go for Matthew McConaughey and his easy coolness.""Alright, alright, alright."""," Surprisingly Great Movie"

"106","The Gentlemen","Faze_Spetim","9/10","8 March 2020","The movie catched me after a few seconds, because I didn't know what was going on and the character of Fletcher is so well played that it just caught me after a few seconds into the film. The film is different from a normal movie because of the timeline structure of the storyline. The actors play fantastic and it is really a pleasure to watch them. Guy Richie really did a very good job. Absolut highlights of the movie is the humour they have and Dry Eye, the Asian gangster.WHY I DON'T GIVE 10 STARS: because in my personal view there is too less interaction with Mickey. I know that the film is not about him (despite the title) but still, I would have wished a few more dialogues with the king of the jungle."," A different kind of movie"
"107","The Gentlemen","pakiman_imzy","6/10","14 February 2020","Firstly I must say the there are good things about this movie just a few bad things that let the filn as a whole down. The story was good, witty, with a shy bit of British dry humour. Those of you that know of the comedian Jack Dee will know what I mean. Now to the bad, having an 18 rating could of made this movie a 10/10 if it was used correctly. If you are going to make an 18 rated british ganster movie, you need to add the correct level of violence. There was hardly any. It's as if the continuous use of the c word was in hope to make up for what was clearly a budgeting issue. This movie clearly used up too much of it's budget on the actors leaving not enough needed to make full use of having an 18 rating.I would not recommend watching this in a cinema and wasting the money on what you are made to believe is an action packed British gangster/comedy. The lack of needed violence lets the film as a whole down."," Could of been so much more."

The cast are great and suit their roles.The characters are well developed and play off some great stereotypes. Matthew McConaughey is great in this as is Colin Farrell. They play the characters without trying to be grandiose in their acting style to steal the show.It is violent and the language is bad so not a movie for general family viewing. It seems like a very similar idea to Pulp Fiction but the story line is a lot better. Pulp Fiction was a story without a story, which was good, but this rates higher for me."," Worth watching."
"113","The Gentlemen","srnmovielover","10/10","31 October 2022","This was surprisingly entertaining. Not just an action movie, it was very funny in parts. As violent as some scenes were, you did actually get to like the protagonists. All the actors were very good, particularly Matthew McConaughey and Colin Farrell; possibly Hugh Grant went a little over the top. Michelle Dockery was great in a role pretty far from Downton Abbey. Jeremy Strong, Henry Golding and Tom Wu make great villains. Overall great cast, lots of action and very funny. What more can you ask? I loved the nod to one of my favorites, The Long Good Friday, a great Bob Hoskins movie, at the end."," Really enjoyed this movie"

Definitely not for family audiences, but for a more mature audience. Loved the acting from all the amazing actors, but for me Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, and Hugh Grant were fantastic."," Spectacular from Start to Finish!"
"115","The Gentlemen","levkovskaya-an","10/10","19 January 2022","A masterpiece painting by Guy Ritchie. I can't agree with the negative reviewers that the actors didn't show us anything new. Take Matthew McConaughey - inimitable in any role. In this picture, he played the main bad guy. After McConaughey managed to break out of the romcom, this is the first film in such an image. And it is played 100%. Hugh Grant took a completely unusual role, which surprised the viewer. Handsome and a heartbreaker? No! A scoundrel in the slimiest sense of the word.Richie tells the story of how Mickey Pearson is trying to end his 'career' in the criminal world. While several characters try to leave him with nothing. The film suddenly begins, flows violently and ends with clarity after all the worries and vanities. They did not miss the love line, although here it was atypical. The beautiful Michelle Dockery added peppercorn in a cheeky way. Mickey Pearson's wife, strong and domineering, turns into a cat (albeit wild) next to Matthew McConaughey's lion. It was interesting to follow their love, although the plot paid almost no attention to the couple. I want to quote dialogues, and copy images. The contrasting images of Hannam and Farrell were especially sunk in.Of course, the film does not have a deep meaning. Or maybe it's just not on the surface. But the film gives emotions, drive, aesthetic and intellectual pleasure. What else do you need? Moreover, I have already reviewed the film twice and intend to do it again. Besides, no matter who I watched it with, all my friends just like me 'went'.A typical crime story mixed with humor and romance, hyperbolized and flavored with jargon. That's what I like!"," Gentlemen of the Hollywood era"
"116","The Gentlemen","danilasmagin","10/10","19 January 2022","In structure, this is a classic Guy Ritchie gangster movie with some small experiments in terms of humor. It will not be a revelation for those who have watched his crime comedies or Matthew Vaughn's film ""Layer Cake"". Experienced moviegoers will easily figure out some of the plot twists, and everyone will laugh at the shameful opening scene. It feels absolutely superfluous, like a rap clip, inappropriately pasted into the narrative. The events in the film are developing smartly, the characters with their various accents replace each other in the frame with enviable regularity, and you don't even need to count on at least an average number of action scenes. The whole action is here in the dialogues. Violence is minimalistic, but there is a lot of profanity. Offensive to women (the word cunt is very often pronounced) and minorities (goes to Asians, Jews and a little black). And all this is wrapped in a stylish picture with a cheerful and interesting soundtrack.""Gentlemen"" is Guy Ritchie's long-awaited return to the crime genre, which can be safely called successful. All the ingredients from past work are in place. Let them not be as exciting as they used to be, but they give a pleasant feeling of nostalgia."," Good"
"117","The Gentlemen","katenagrebneva","10/10","19 January 2022","Great movie!an amazing cast, everything is in its place, Matthew, who has aged after participating in a series of ""strange"" films, has returned to good work! Guy Ritchie also rehabilitated himself and showed a good project to waste time after his divorce. Definitely you need to watch this, because ""The gentlemen"" will soon become a classic that everyone should watch at least once in their life."," Amazing!"
"118","The Gentlemen","aasavvv","10/10","19 January 2022","Gentlemen"" is a crime comedy-thriller from the recognized master of the genre Guy Ritchie. The plot of the film is presented as a story within a story. One of the heroes of the film seriously wrote a whole script based on the events he saw. In fact, we only see 10% of the feed in real time. Everything else is a kind of imagination game of the participants of the dialogue. Some sudden and interesting turns are built on this, when the characters themselves admit that they simply invented some scenes.Nevertheless, there is a story in the film - a story rich in events, twisted and cunningly intertwined. All in the spirit of the good old Guy Ritchie. From this point of view, cinema is an ideological (and stylistic) continuation of his debut works ""Cards, money, two barrels"" and ""Big Jackpot"". And ""Gentlemen"" turned out so well that now it's even impossible to say clearly which of these three films is the best.The story, despite its versatility, is still not based on sudden plot twists (and there are plenty of them here), but on the heroes. The characters of the film, again in the spirit of classic Richie, are worked out to the smallest detail. Each of them is colorful, unusual in its own way, with its own unique details and character traits. Everyone is remembered without exception. And the coolest characters are those who seem to appear only in a few scenes. Strength and coolness in details - these ""Gentlemen"" are very captivating.There is also a diverse set of statements in the film, which seem to cut through the main issues of the generation. Guy Ritchie walked, it seems, on all the most relevant topics of the present day: from racism and social inequality to the legalization of drugs. The topic of cultural differences between the USA and the UK is separately disclosed. Richie is good because his reasoning on these topics does not get out of the general rhythm and style of the tape. The dialogue about racism will be as dynamic and sharp as a gang fight or a swashbuckling chase.The visual side of the tape deserves special praise. The costumes in the film are perfectly matched. The clothes also emphasize the colorfulness of the characters. Each of them has his own unique style not only in behavior, but also in appearance. The camerawork is impeccable and diverse. In the tape, there is also the staging of scenes familiar to a wide audience, and clip editing, and even shooting from GoPro cameras. The meticulousness of the approach is also visible in working with color and light.Summing up all of the above, we can draw an obvious conclusion - Guy Ritchie has returned to the roots. And he returned brilliantly. The director finally got the opportunity to do something of his own again, without adjusting to the direction of studio bosses. Here we have the original Richie again - the one we fell in love with twenty years ago. At the same time, the director is noticeably progressing and in his new work does not slip into self-repetition. ""Gentlemen"" does not copy any of Richie's previous films and is quite a self-sufficient and original work."," Wonderful movie"
"119","The Gentlemen","kirkapupurka","7/10","19 January 2022","The new film will definitely be an outlet for those who fell in love with Richie precisely for the crime, vivid images of bandits and intricate plots. This is the ""return to the roots"" that we have been waiting for. Although it is still necessary to take into account the fact that ""Gentlemen"" is no longer being shot by a young aspiring director, prone to enthusiasm and experiments, but by a solid master.But for the most part, it only went to the plus. Richie is not trying to repeat the success of the first films, he shows that even the world of crime itself has changed, where now everything has become more solid and measured. And therefore, the whole action, although it will surprise you with a sudden turn in the first frames, will be a little calmer, leaving room for beautiful filming and just witty dialogues.In fact, the whole film is a direct speech - Fletcher's story about his guesses, moreover, served in the style of ""Get a shorty"". This approach allows Richie to simultaneously shoot a crime comedy and partially deconstruct the genre itself. Since most of what is happening is one big flashback, and even from an unreliable narrator, in a couple of scenes, the action is literally ""unwound"", showing the difference between rumors and reality, ironic about the ability to lip-read conversations, or even completely complement the action with inscriptions on the screen."," The Gentlemen"
"120","The Gentlemen","nabohar-58593","10/10","19 January 2022","Yes, I'm tempted to say he's back. It's not that he's gone or he hasn't had at least a few decent films in the last few years. I didn't see Aladdin, but he was kind of successful. But that's just his part! It's pure and likable Guy Ritchie, with timeline cuts, jumps and characters you'd think only he could write.It's so great to see Matthew McConaughey join our ranks, I think he will replace Jason Statham. But also Hugh Grant's involvement... role/character. Genius! Who could do it and he kills him (no pun intended). At least a few turns will be easy to spot, but I don't think you can guess everything. However, the movie is so well done that it won't really matter. If you like this genre then this is the one to watch.

"121","The Gentlemen","rkolobov","10/10","19 January 2022","For those who knew Guy Ritchie's work from better times, the new one will not come as a pleasant surprise. Scolded by everyone (but my favorite) and generally recognized as the weakest (before the release of The Gentlemen) crime thriller Rock and Roller, the main claim to which was the creative auto-repeat, surpasses The Gentlemen in all respects. But it is worth paying tribute to the director for the courage to return to the roots, and for the fact that despite the unconvincing comeback, the new work is one of the few entertaining films worthy of attention in recent times. Moreover, thanks to films like The Gentlemen, when comparing, you often come across the phrase 'in the style of Guy Ritchie', and this must be earned."," Comeback"
"122","The Gentlemen","sevasteevamargo","10/10","19 January 2022","""GENTLEMEN."" - Guy Ritchie's elegant comeback. The director has returned to his roots, and I'd like to say that's what was missing. The film is fun, intriguing and entertaining. The concept of the almanac is far from new, but it will never be beaten if you have a good script on hand. The picture grabs the viewer's attention. And not only because of the very intriguing plot, but also because of the colorful characters. Driven crime thriller with great humor. The film has a powerful atmosphere, an interesting story and unrealistically cool, colorful characters with different sets of qualities that set them apart. This is accompanied by great action sequences and good acting. Even with such a hackneyed concept, you can make a great final product that is sure to please fans of the genre."," Super cool"
"123","The Gentlemen","vanodmitriew","8/10","19 January 2022","A talented Oxford graduate, using his unique mind and unprecedented audacity, came up with an illegal enrichment scheme using the estates of the impoverished English aristocracy. However, when he decides to sell his business to an influential clan of US billionaires, no less charming but tough gentlemen stand in his way. An exchange of pleasantries is planned, which definitely will not do without shootings and a couple of accidents.So, it happened: the British 'talent' Guy Ritchie returned 'to his roots' (as if the previous picture of the British - 'Aladdin' and a couple of paintings in front of it - there was some kind of 'misunderstanding', which I want to forget a little), and understand that the true Guy Ritchie is back 'in a big way'. The plot in the film is multifaceted (and I don't want to particularly 'spoiler'), but the film itself - to use a phrase from the film itself - is still a 'grease tale': the whole film is a 'borderline conversation' between private detective Fletcher and one of Mickey Pearson's assistants - Raymond Smith, who, over glasses of whiskey and barbecue, are discussing the affairs of recently past days: showdowns of some heroes with others, when one and the second are building a 'deal', and the third and fourth are trying to break it and take the 'jackpot' for themselves. Here, on the estates of the impoverished English aristocracy, marijuana is grown, a gang of young 'bouncers' in tracksuits with a pattern of 'English tweed' terrorize everyone in the district, the Chinese mafia is on the alert, and one of the editors of the local 'tabloid' is forced to rape a pig. 'Gentlemen' is a return to 'roots' after 20 years. It's got a great cast that tries to 'outplay' each other, and who immediately caught the 'essence'. This film is an explosive mixture of drive, impudence, youth and the belief that by doing the most vile deeds, the main characters remain gentlemen."," Impression often depends on expectation"
"124","The Gentlemen","lerablkk","9/10","19 January 2022","The presentation of the plot is implemented as a retelling of the journalist about his surveillance and ingenious conclusions that he made in the course of events. It's very exciting and exciting, but in the middle of the film you start to feel that something is wrong and you're looking at a picture within a picture.The rest of the film is close to the satirical ideal and with its irony makes you laugh even from Hollywood clichés. But behind the secondness lies the same Guy Ritchie from the 2000s, who, with his hyper-realistic model of narration, is able to lure any viewer. Therefore, I warmly recommend this picture for viewing, and I hope it will give you pleasure."," The Gentleman"
"125","The Gentlemen","MishaMashina",NA,"19 January 2022","Guy Ritchie pleased. I do not share the negative reviews, those who believe that the director is exhausted or something like that. For me, the film is of high quality and coped with its role. The mood lifts, keeps in suspense, the actors are handsome. And especially pleased with the soundtrack and costumes. Now I want tracksuits in which the guys dance there)The theme of the film is of course hype, relevant, on which the script was built. Personally, I was pleased with the plot twists and want to continue. As a result, I watched this movie with my boyfriend, he also got it, but my friend tried twice and nothing came of it, she fell asleep. I don't think everyone will understand this movie. But fans of Guy Ritchie, Tarantino and other bright directors can rejoice and find something special for themselves."," Gentlemen of fun and recklessness!"
"126","The Gentlemen","jtindahouse","9/10","1 January 2020","Has there ever been a bad performance in a Guy Ritchie movie? If there has I haven't noticed it. He has an ornate ability to take average actors and make them great, and to take already great actors and get even more out of them. There are a few directors around who specialise in this but Ritchie is right near the top. The cast in 'The Gentlemen' is admittedly fantastic, but it doesn't change the fact that they are an absolute treat to watch. Matthew McConaughey is in his element in a role that he was born to play, Charlie Hunnam plays one of the coolest characters I've seen perfectly, Colin Farrell is hilarious and ridiculously cool as well and then Hugh Grant gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from him. In fact Grant was so good I didn't even recognise his voice and had to wonder if they'd dubbed it. They hadn't, he'd just nailed it.The style this movie possesses is just so much fun to watch. If you've seen any of Ritchie's previous similar films ('Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', 'Snatch', 'RocknRolla') then you know what I'm talking about. The pacing moves at lightning speed, the dialogue is quick, clever and deeper than you first realise and the conflict is always multi-layered. This one is actually told in quite a unique way with a couple of characters going over events that have already happened and it works masterfully. It breaks the story up and gives room for creativity in the story-telling process and also humour.Every time I see that Ritchie has made a movie that isn't a crime-thriller I get a little disappointed. It's not that the other stuff he's doing is bad ('Swept Away' being an obvious exception), it's just that he is so damn good as this style of movie. He's the best in the business and if he only did these for the rest of his career I'd be a very happy man. This is an excellent movie well worth your time and money."," Ritchie returns to the crime genre and does so masterfully"
"127","The Gentlemen","planktonrules","9/10","13 September 2020","Aside from a few very marketable films like ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" and ""Aladdin"", Guy Ritchie is a writer/director who makes incredibly violent films. That is, incredibly violent films which are also brilliantly constructed and near perfect. While I rarely ever watch violent films, I eagerly look for his next dark British crime film, after seeing his ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch""....and so it's not surprising I'd see ""The Gentlemen"". And, like these other films, it's near perfect...and a film you ought to see if you have the stomach for this sort of story.So this leads me to a huge warning. This is NOT a family-friendly film nor one you want to show your mother or Father Jenkins if he stops by for a visit. There's ample cursing, loads of violence, vomit galore, and the story is about bad people...very bad people.The story is complicated...and goes together like a finely crafted puzzle. It concerns a marijuana czar in Britain, Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) and his desire to sell out and retire to a life of ease and sophistication. However, after making an offer to a rival drug kingpin, suddenly everything goes haywire....folks start dying, farms growing the stuff are hit and an all-out war seems inevitable. There's WAY more to the story than this...but since it's so complex, it's best you just see it to appreciate it.The bottom line is that Guy Ritchie can write and direct amazing films...and this one is truly amazing and entertaining. Apart from his misguided vanity project, ""Swept Away"", his output has been impressive and I cannot stress enough what a quality product this film is. My only MINOR quibble is what about the Russian mobster.....what happens with him? This isn't really dealt with in the film and seems a bit like a dangling plot point."," That's Hugh Grant?!

"131","The Gentlemen","GusherPop","10/10","10 April 2023","Guy Ritchie's ""The Gentlemen"" plays like a tall tale, filled with exaggerations and embellishments, where the storyteller expects you to pay his bar tab at the end. The narrator is a conniving private detective named Fletcher (Hugh Grant), who sets out to blackmail everyone with a screenplay he's written. The screenplay is called ""BUSH,"" bush being a euphemism for ""marijuana"" and is a complicated tale about the ""turf war"" in the marijuana business. The ""bush"" double entendre is also present, just for the chuckles factor. Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) is an American who sees an opportunity in the languishing English aristocracy. He is married to Roz (Michelle Dockery), a ""Cockney cleopatra"" who runs an auto body shop with only women mechanics. Mickey loves his wife and is ready to retire from the weed business. Two rivals emerge as potential buyers: an American Jewish billionaire and a Chinese-Cockney gangster named Dry Eye. Colin Farrell's ""Coach"" is an Irish guy who runs a boxing club. Mickey's right-hand man is Ray (Charlie Hunnan), a mild-mannered man who looks like a desk clerk until you see him in action. The ""gentlemen"" of the title is clearly meant sarcastically. Hugh Grant gives an extraordinary performance in ""The Gentlemen"". The script, which Ritchie co-wrote with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies, plays around with genre tropes, but the overriding structure is Fletcher ""pitching"" his script to an increasingly horrified Ray. This ""pitch"" goes on for the entirety of the film, and so as scenes unfold, it is as though the scenes emanate from Fletcher's imagination, when in reality we are seeing what really happened. Guy Ritchie's latest gangster comedy presents itself as a harmless romp, but behind its wink-wink-nudge-nudge humour is a bitter and dated worldview. Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) is an American interloper and marijuana dealer who wants out of the game. He hopes to liquidate his weed-farm empire, and interested buyers include Jewish-American billionaire Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) and Chinese mobster ""Dry Eye"" (Crazy Rich Asians' Henry Golding). We learn of Mickey's plans and their inevitable unravelling through a screenplay written by sleazy private investigator and aspiring screenwriter Fletcher (Hugh Grant). The screenplay is, of course, blackmail, with which Fletcher hopes to exploit Mickey. Ritchie's signature sweary patter is enjoyable, except for the racism, which is especially pointed given the racial delineation of the film's heroes and villains. Fletcher is a parasite, one of those tabloid ""writers"" who loves to be ""in"" on things, and sees people and their reputations as disposable. The entire script is a script within a script, and this is its ace in the hole: there is always one layer between us and the characters. Hugh Grant has become a formidable character actor in the last couple of years, taking full advantage of his options. The one-two punch of ""Paddington 2"" and ""A Very English Scandal"" is a perfect example of this, as Grant is using all of these other acting muscles he normally hadn't been asked to use, and he's thrilling in a role which is mostly exposition. There's one moment where he puts his hand on Hunnam's knee, realizes it's an unwelcome touch, and goes into this wild pop-eyed, ""Oopsie #sorrynotsorry"" facial expression. It's his favorite kind of humor, character-based, behavior-based, and he acts as his own gravitational force. Mickey Pearson may be the lead, but it's Fletcher who gets the last word."," A Pure masterpiece"
"132","The Gentlemen","boblipton","8/10","26 January 2020","Matthew McConaughey, who has become one of the major players in the British weed trade through science, paying poor noblemen to let him stash his farms on their property, and a judicious amount of leg-breaking, thinks it's time to retire. He offers to sell his business to a fellow entrepreneur for £400,000,000, but other people in the illegal fun trade have their own agendas.Guy Ritchie has returned to his early themes of violence, chaos, and rock&roll from his early career, and has scored a definite hit, with some fine performances, including a blank-faced one by Charlie Hunnam and an outsized comedy turn by Colin Farrell. Hugh Grant does well as the unwanted on-screen narrator of events, putting them into some order; I am impressed by his lack of a posh accent, event as I wished Ritchie had been able to think of a better way of telling the audience the story.Even with that cavil, the unceasing action and insanity kept me more than interested throughout."," Ritchie Back In Form"
"133","The Gentlemen","classicsoncall","9/10","1 September 2020","Any Guy Ritchie film I've seen, he always delivers, especially when he's writer and director. This one follows in the tradition of ""Rocknrolla"", ""Snatch"", and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", the story layered with multiple sets of gangsters trying to outdo each other for the grand prize at the end of the flick. I got a kick out of the opening scene in which the bartender pouring Michael Pearson's (Matthew McConaughey) pint pulls down on the bar tap handle reading 'Ritchie Sewing Company', a self promoting piece of business I found pretty clever.This one doesn't seem to be as hard to follow as the earlier mentioned films. All of them prompted a second viewing to catch all the nuance of the characters, but this one, even with the chronology going back and forth, was pretty straightforward. That's probably due to the format, essentially a narration of events by journalist Fletcher (Hugh Grant) relating his investigative work to Pearson's right hand man, bodyguard and driver Raymond (Charlie Hunnam). Colin Farrell's character is simply known as 'Coach', and he's drawn into the story by virtue of his gangsta underlings botching a take down of one of Pearson's weed farms. What could have been an ancillary character winds up being central to the outcome of the story.And just about when you think it's over, another twist occurs with the introduction of a Russian oligarch and his mission of revenge for the death of his son. All the while you have to wonder how the picture's principal character, that would be Pearson, manages to come out of the story intact, considering all the bad guys who want to do him in. It's a fun watch if you go for this kind of stuff, made all the merrier by the script's creative use of the English language. You know, maybe I will watch this all over again."," ""I'm basing my crescendo on the sum of it's parts."""
"134","The Gentlemen","eelen-seth","9/10","1 January 2020","The rather unconventional visionary Guy Ritchie has been stuck in a Hollywood rut for the last ten years, ever since he committed to big budget, visual effects heavy films, such as Sherlock Holmes, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and this year's underwhelming live action version of the classic Disney, 'Aladdin'. The British director goes back to his roots with the highly entertaining gangster film 'The Gentlemen' and surprisingly nails every bold punch he makes.Although his 'Aladdin' made a ton of money, critically the film was a disaster. His return to the underground world of bribery, drugs, money-laundering and blood-covered-class, is as refreshing as it is entertaining. The film's script deals with two storylines at the same time, almost breaking the fourth wall with a tongue-in-cheek commentary on today's Hollywood and how big movie studios are hungry for some original yet overly mainstream basic content, to lure people into cinemas to go watch their films.Beginning with a quick flash forward that ends with a bang and a pair of brains splattered all over a pint and a pickled egg at a typical British pub, we dial it back to a quiet evening at Raymond's (Charlie Hunnam) cosy house. When private investigator and intrusive sly fox, Fletcher (Hugh Grant), turns up at his house, he explains he has been keeping an eye on the different gangs around town for quite a while. Narrating most of the film and making some stuff up to make things more spectacular for himself, he reads his mostly finished movie script to Raymond, bribing him into funding his little project, or else he'll leak all the information he has on Raymond's boss Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a white trash American expat who has build himself a marijuana empire.Mickey is tired of the business and is trying to sell his highly profitable company to a dynasty of Oklahoma billionaires. But when one of the underground weed-plantations gets raided by a group of British lads, filming the entire thing and posting it on YouTube as some sort of fight--music-video, it quickly becomes clear some mobster bosses haven't been exactly honest about their meetings and loyalty towards each other. This is when the real war begins - while keeping it classy.Ritchie co-wrote the story with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies, who haven't written anything before. The idea of the entire film is prodigious, but the screenplay and dialogue is simply unprecedented by Ritchie himself, bringing joke after joke, while taking you on a thrilling ride full of genius twists and new ways to incorporate classic gangster cinema - Ritchie-style. Composer Christopher Benstead is debuting his very first score for a feature film with The Gentlemen, and knows exactly how to set the tone and drive it up to an eleven. A promising talent that won't go unnoticed.Ritchie introduces new characters throughout the film, keeping the audience on the edge of their seat, surprising them with actual cinema, getting the best angles and money shots, thanks to his cinematographer Alan Stewart (Aladdin). When adding layer after layer to the story, going deeper into the underground scene, adding a new protagonist who's into human trafficking and Mickey's queen and wife, the cockney Cleopatra, Rosalind (Michelle Dockery), who owns a sanctuary for the ladies as some sort of business coverup to her husband's weed-empire, it becomes clear every role has a purpose and there are no extras involved in this story. One of the best acting ensembles in recent cinema history, and a welcome reminder from McConnaughey as to why he won an Oscar in the first place. But it's Colin Farrell (as the highly entertaining 'Coach') and Hugh Grant who steal every scene they're in with their remarkable wit that'll for sure land them some BAFTA-nominations.'The Gentlemen' is a ruthless first-class kick in the teeth. Do not let the failures of Ritchie's recent career choices scare you, as this is actually one of the best films he's ever made. Who knew Guy Ritchie could raise the bar not just for himself, but for everyone out there trying to brush him off as a has been. 2020 is off to a great start!"," A ruthless first-class kick in the teeth!"

Matthew McConaughey is American Mickey Pearson who went to England as a young man on a Rhodes Scholarship. He soon learned that he had a knack for selling drugs to fellow students and that eventually blossomed into his vocation on a very broad scale. Now in middle age has decided to sell his marijuana empire, which included a dozen well-hidden farms, and retire to a leisurely life and maybe have a few rug rats with his beautiful and devoted wife. The price? Just 400 million British Pounds.As the news of that gets around a number of shady operators want to get their cuts from a number of devious means. So the movie is mainly about that and how Mickey and those loyal to him devise methods to protect him and his investments. The cast includes a number of well-known actors and the roles are uniformly interesting.This is a good movie for those who appreciate and enjoy this type of British underworld movie, there aren't really any characters who are good people, there are just different degrees of badness.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped, not her kind of movie."," It's not enough to act like the king, you have to BE the king."

(The) Country of Shakespeare, Churchill, The Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter, David Beckham's right foot ... David Beckham's left foot come to think of it.""Well, in my opinion, he forgot to mention Guy Ritchie, who is known for his gangster films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000) among others, as well as the Sherlock Holmes' films of 2009 and 2011. With The Gentlemen, Guy Ritchie goes one step further in proving himself a national treasure of our friends the Brits.With the help of a cast comprised of big names and lovable favorites such as Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant and the inimitable Colin Farrell, as well as an intelligent, engaging and entertaining script, Guy Ritchie once again comes through in delivering sumptuous fare for the eyes and ears and heart. Here, Mickey Pearson (McConaughey), is a powerful American marijuana dealer based in England whose plan it is to retire and sell off his marijuana empire for a cool £400 Million to spend more time with his wife. As can be expected, more than a wrench is thrown into his plan. What ensues, is giddy entertainment a'la Chef Ritchie's Specialty of witty, super-fast, intelligent, humorous exchanges and more than a few sleights-of-hand by a gallery of engaging and colorful characters who are thrown into numerous subplots, countless twists and turns, betrayals, confrontations and several inevitable revelations.Sounds confusing 'duneh it'? It isn't.Sit back and enjoy the rich mischievousness with which this is all served and rest assured that Ritchie is a master.

"144","The Gentlemen","BA_Harrison","9/10","12 January 2020","Having spent a decade or so making Hollywood blockbusters (with varying degrees of success), director Guy Ritchie returns to the genre that first made him famous: Tarantino à la UK. Some might see this as a backwards step, but in my opinion, it's what he does best.This time around, the ace in Ritchie's hand is Hugh Grant, who brilliantly plays pivotal character Fletcher, a tabloid reporter who tries to blackmail powerful drug lord Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), threatening to publish an extremely damaging story if he doesn't receive a payment of £20m within 72 hours. The film unfolds as Fletcher tells Pearson's right hand man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) the story of how he gathered the dirt on his boss. Grant's performance is pure genius: playing against type he is seriously sleazy and frequently hilarious.Not that the rest of the cast are any slouches: Hunnam is cool and badass, Colin Farrell displays a keen comedic touch as tough gym owner Coach, McConaughey is his usual affable self (but with a seriously dangerous edge), Michelle Dockery impresses as Pearson's spunky wife Rosalind, and Jeremy Strong holds his own as the criminal who wants to buy Pearson's marijuana operation. Even the minor characters are great as well, from the Coach's grime-loving lads 'TheToddlers' to the obnoxious housing estate yoofs who give Ray's 'muscle' the runaround.Ritchie's writing and direction is possibly his best yet, the script sparkling with wit and the visuals both stylish and confident. The dialogue is extremely funny (and loaded with expletives), the violence gloriously OTT, and the characters memorable. It might be a case of Ritchie 'playing it safe' by revisiting familiar territory, but when the result is as entertaining as this, why the hell not?"," Must hold the record for the most frequent use of the 'C' word."

Written and directed by Guy Ritchie this has all his trademarks: gangsters as the good guys (and bad guys), clever, gritty plot with some great twists, great tongue-in cheek humour. It is a tour de force by Ritchie and, as much as I love Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch and RocknRolla, is his best work.Not only does the film play to Ritchie's strengths it also feels less formulaic than his usual gangster-crime offerings. While he is good at what he does, his plots do feel a bit repetitive at times. This, while still falling in his usual arc, has an originality about it which is quite refreshing.All this is helped by a star-studded cast - Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, Colin Farrell, Eddie Marsan - none of whom put a foot wrong. Hugh Grant is almost unrecognisable as the slimy journalist: a great departure from the shy, nerdy roles he is known for.Highly recommended."," Superb"

"149","The Gentlemen","Bertaut","9/10","14 January 2020","The Gentlemen is a return to the London gangster milieu where writer/director Guy Ritchie first made his name with films such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000). His first foray into this territory since the disappointing RocknRolla (2008), The Gentlemen comes at the end of over a decade making big-budget studio-backed crimes against cinema. Granted, the film seems stuck in the last decade in more ways than one, it's highly questionable that the only gay character is a slimy S&M proponent who'll sleep with pretty much anyone, its token female character barely even manages to rise to the level of tokenism, and Ritchie does absolutely nothing new here - if you've seen Lock, Stock or snatch., you'll know pretty much exactly what to expect - but The Gentlemen is still hugely entertaining. Most of the jokes land, the dialogue is as sharp and expletive-laden as ever, the cast are having a ball, and the self-reflexivity, although a little forced in places, works well for the most part. And yes, the plot is as derivative as it gets, but there's no denying Ritchie has injected real verve into what looks on paper like an inconsequential C-movie. The Gentlemen definitely won't change your life, but it will make you laugh.The film begins as sleazy private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) arrives unannounced at the home of Ray (Charlie Hunnam), right-hand man to Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a suave Oxford-educated American ex-pat who controls a huge marijuana empire in London, valued at around £400 million. Several months prior, Fletcher was hired by tabloid editor Big Dave (the great Eddie Marsan) to dig up dirt on Pearson with the aim to ruin him - Dave's revenge for Pearson blanking him at a gala. Fletcher has written a screenplay based on his investigation (titled Bush) and tells Ray that unless Pearson pays him £20 million, he will hand over everything he has to Dave. Meanwhile, Pearson has decided to sell his whole operation, but when word gets out, all hell breaks loose, as the various interested parties vie for advantage. Most of the subsequent film takes the form of Fletcher narrating his exploits to Ray, explaining how he learned so much about Pearson and what he does. Along the way, we meet characters such as Rosalind (Michelle Dockery), Pearson's ruthless and unflappable ""cockney Cleopatra"" wife, who runs a garage with an all-female staff; Berger (Jeremy Strong), Pearson's preferred buyer; Dry Eye (Henry Golding), the ambitious but brutal scion of a Chinese syndicate, who hopes to undermine Berger; Coach (a scene-stealing Colin Farrell), who runs a boxing gym for troubled youths and who inadvertently finds himself in the middle of everything; a plethora of property-rich-but-cash-poor landed gentry who are essential to Pearson's empire; a Russian oligarch; and a street gang called The Toddlers.Aesthetically, The Gentlemen is very much in the mould of Ritchie's previous gangster movies. Because Fletcher frames his narration as a screenplay, it allows Ritchie to employ a multitude of self-reflexive devices - a smash cut coinciding with Fletcher asking Ray to visualise a smash cut; voiceover transitioning into spoken dialogue; on-screen captions telling us who's who; animated maps; YouTube fight porn (don't ask); freeze-frames; rewinds; a shot of film running through a projector etc. At one point, Fletcher is discussing the merits of anamorphic (2.39:1) over 1.78:1, and the film's aspect ratio changes accordingly. At another, he's arguing for the merits of 35mm celluloid over digital, saying he likes the grain of celluloid photography, and the film duly switches formats. Such playfulness means that it never for a second takes itself too seriously, with probably the most self-reflexive moment coming towards the end, when we visit Miramax's offices in London (Miramax produced the movie), and we see a poster for Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015). All of this is immensely fun, with the more you know about the mechanics of assembling a film, the more humorously self-reflexive the film becomes - Fletcher even acknowledges his own role as an unreliable narrator.In terms of themes, the most obvious is something Ritchie has examined before - the idea that the economic divide between gangsters and aristocrats masks their practical similarities. Pearson straddles this divide; he's a gangster, but so too is he an aristocrat (in all but name), and the smooth running of his business depends on both classes - the aristocrats who he needs to grow his product (for reasons that constitute a bit of a spoiler, so I'm not going to get into it) and the gangsters who distribute that product. The clash between the pompous insularity of the English upper class and the perceived uncouthness of the lower class has been done to death in both literature (Wuthering Heights (1847) springs to mind) and film (Performance (1970), for example), and although Ritchie doesn't say anything even remotely new about it, it still forms an interesting textural background - gentrification is ever-present; there are ironic references to the posh areas of Croydon; Ray, a working-class Newcastle native, is a cleanliness freak who eats wagyu steak and lives in a mansion, and when he's dispatched on a mission to an uncivilised working-class area, he explains he ""just hates them junkies,"" seeing them as very much his social inferiors.One of the most central scenes sees a group of obnoxious privileged teens holed up in a council flat, whilst on the street below, a gang of machete-wielding delinquents terrorise the neighbourhood. As Ray and his men clash with the gang, there's a real sense of old vs. new - traditional gangsters fighting it out with internet-savvy hoodlums who don't give a damn about tradition or respect. There are a lot of laughs to be had with these issues, such as Ray and Coach having problems pronouncing the name Phuc. And again, none of this is presented as even remotely serious.The biggest problems with the film are probably its lack of depth, and the familiarity of the presentation, characters, and milieu - there's nothing here you haven't seen in previous Ritchie films. And as you would expect, there isn't much in the way of emotional maturity or narrative complexity. It's all very surface-level, and it makes no apologies for such.Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed The Gentlemen. It's a funny as hell caper and the actors are clearly having terrific fun. It might be formulaic and overly familiar, but it's also immensely enjoyable."," Nothing too unexpected here, but it's funny and hugely entertaining"

It would be nicer if the 2 white main friend characters were likeable, but they're really just one full character split into ""nice"" and ""mean"" characteristics.John Cena unsurprisingly steals and runs the show in the best way. He gets to do hilarious skits, show off impressions, do a million outfits changes including wigs and makeup, and make you bust up in the same sentence he makes you tear up."," Hilarious without going overboard"

Seriously, these guys have some serious talent and they've brought us some unforgettable films. One of their best collaborations has to be ""Neighbors"" (2014). It's a comedy goldmine where Zac Efron plays the leader of a crazy fraternity, and James Franco pops in with a hilarious cameo. Seth Rogen's comedic timing ties everything together perfectly.But wait, there's more! They also rocked it in ""The Disaster Artist"" (2017), where James Franco directs and stars as the quirky filmmaker Tommy Wiseau. It's based on the making of the cult classic ""The Room."" Franco nails it as Wiseau, earning him tons of praise and award nominations. Seth Rogen's role adds another layer of behind-the-scenes hilarity.And let's not forget their solo projects. Zac Efron showed off his dramatic chops in ""The Greatest Showman"" (2017), where he shines alongside Hugh Jackman and Zendaya. James Franco blew us away in ""127 Hours"" (2010) with his intense portrayal of a guy trapped in a canyon. And Seth Rogen? He's not just the funny guy; he's got serious acting chops too, as seen in ""50/50"" (2011) and ""Steve Jobs"" (2015).These three guys are more than just actors; they're storytellers who know how to entertain and move audiences. Whether they're making us laugh, cry, or sit on the edge of our seats, Zac Efron, James Franco, and Seth Rogen always deliver the goods."," The boys are back"

If my son was going to be circumcised by a fraud I met at a casino, i would have stopped the whole thing and saved my son. This part does not make sense to me.

"172","Ricky Stanicky","FALLEN_XO","9/10","3 April 2024","""Ricky Stanicky"" is a comedy that brings a fresh and engaging premise to the table. The story follows a group of friends who create a fake person named ""Ricky Stanicky"" as an excuse to get out of various situations. However, this fabrication takes an unexpected turn when an actor ends up actually portraying the made-up character, leading to a hilarious and increasingly complex series of events.The Engaging Premise:
The core concept of ""Ricky Stanicky"" is genuinely intriguing. The idea of these characters inventing a fictional person to serve as a scapegoat sets up a lot of comedic potential, as they have to continually maintain the ruse and deal with the unexpected consequences. The way the ""Stanicky"" persona evolves from a simple excuse to a fully-realized character played by an actor is a clever twist that keeps the plot feeling fresh and unpredictable.The Comedic Highlights:
The film's strongest elements are the well-written dialogue scenes and the increasingly absurd situations the characters find themselves in as they try to keep up the Ricky Stanicky charade. Watching them desperately try to cover their tracks and come up with increasingly outlandish explanations is consistently amusing. The actor who ends up portraying Stanicky also delivers a wonderfully over-the-top performance that adds to the comedy. John Cena is the actor I'm mentioning.The Uneven Execution:
While the premise is strong, the execution can be a bit uneven at times. Some of the storylines veer into territory that feels a bit too silly or contrived, stretching the premise to the point where it loses some of its comedic impact. The ending, in particular, feels a bit rushed and features some twists that lack true originality.Recommendation:
Overall, ""Ricky Stanicky"" is a comedy that I would recommend to those looking for an intriguing and original plot, as long as they don't take the film too seriously, especially towards the end. The engaging premise and well-written comedic moments make it a worthwhile watch, even if the execution stumbles at times. It's a film that offers some genuine laughs and a refreshing approach to the genre."," Ricky Stanicky Review"

So when it dropped on Prime i gave it a watch and i didn't laugh so hard in a long time.Disclaimer, i had my share of beers, but i often drink when i watch these types of movie, and here i was litterally bursting in laugh all the time. Its not like its super clever jokes or anything but i truly miss trash/toilet humor and stuff like that wich has been gone for a while now due to the politically correct era, and this movie serve me on this a lot and it work because John Cena is so good at comedy.When he was a wrestler can't say i was a huge fan, exept at the start when he played a heel rapper (Dr of Thugonamics). But as an actor, i really like him, even more in comedy than action movies.The concept is pretty absurde and its not a movie you have to take too seriously, it has some ""convenience moments"" to say the least, but it work so well and its so funny i easily dismissed that aspect.I wouldn't be surprise if the name Ricky Stanicky start to spread online as aliases like Mclovin did when Superbad was released.I taught about giving it an 8 out of 10 but its a solid 8.5 for sure and i have no issue bumping it to 9.

"186","Ricky Stanicky","cstahler-47698","8/10","7 March 2024","I went into Ricky Stanicky with an open mind but ultimately low expectations. Comedy movies just haven't been hitting the same as they used to, you know?Well, I thought I would stop watching about 20 minutes in, but kept going through because it grabbed my interest, once John Cena's character comes on screen though, I was fully sold and realized I'd be watching the movie all the way through, and I'm glad I did.Ricky Stanicky feels like a return to form for comedy movies, I would have seen this in theaters and likely invited friends to join me. It isn't perfect by any means and it requires you to take leaps of logical faith at times, but to me, comedy movies almost require a component of that, the best comedy movies for me are always just absurd and unlikely, like Joe Dirt. Maybe that's why I love this so much, there are parallels of a loveable loser doing the impossible with a pure heart.The core friend group is made of promising actors as well who do a good job, Zac Efron has a great history of solid comedy films, Jermaine Fowler was awesome in The Blackening, and Andrew Santino has a few solid comedic roles as well.However, the movie is really sold through Ricky/Rod's commitment and likability, when John Cena is on the screen, I'm locked in and typically laughing the hardest.John Cena's performance is a knock out for me. He's funny, he's interesting, he's admirable in certain ways, but he's so damn likable as Ricky Stanicky that I genuinely couldn't help but side with him despite all the red flags and the lunacy of the situation.The confrontation scene between him and Dean had me wondering how I would react in this absurd situation, I gave Dean a lot of flack during the scene, but I can't imagine reacting differently and to me that spoke volumes to Ricky for me.The humor is crass and gross at times while other times it'll surprise you with a joke that has a well made point.At the end of the day, I can truly say if I had seen this at 12, it probably would have been my favorite movie at the time and one I watched throughout the years.

"189","Ricky Stanicky","NateWatchesCoolMovies","8/10","2 April 2024","John Cena continues his surprisingly effective lovable goofball shtick in Peter Farrelly's Ricky Stanicky, a refreshingly old school comedy and by old school I don't mean mid 2000's Seth Rogen type stuff, I mean late 90's to *early* 2000's era when the Farrellys were top of their game. There's just something so unmistakable yet kind of inexplicable about their brand of humour, and I miss it. Zac Efron, Jermaine Fowler and Andrew Santino (Bad Friends Podcast!) are three lifelong pals who have made up a nonexistent best friend called Ricky Stanicky to throw under the bus anytime they get in trouble. It's worked for them so far but they've gotten so deep into such a silly lie that now their wives wanna meet this Ricky fella. In desperation they turn to alcoholic, washed up porn actor RockHard Rod (Cena) to play this fictitious Stanicky character and it goes about as uproariously off the rails as you might expect. Now I read that Jim Carrey was an original choice for the role which would have presented a totally different energy indeed, in another timeline. There's something so off the wall about seeing a dude like Cena, built like an F-350, playing an utterly silly screwball like Rod and pretending to be a guy who completely doesn't even exist yet has an elaborate false backstory written for him. It's a terrific premise and it's given the typically hilarious Farrelly treatment, even if it's only one of the brothers behind the camera this time. All the actors are more than game and do a fine job including William H. Macy doing a hysterical lampoon of his usually sincere persona and Farrelly's own daughter Apple in a lowkey scene stealing turn as Rod's refreshingly down to earth, adorably awkward love interest. It's just fun, in an era when comedy has often forgotten to be so, I've always had a deep love and nostalgic appreciation for the Farrelly's creative output and it's so comforting to see that decades after their heyday they're still making great comedy."," I miss Farrelly comedies"

I know a lot of people will say it's awful and a waste of time & been there done that but I throughly enjoyed it and laughed quite a bit.Now while not being the best film obviously it's only a 6/10 but I couldn't help but laugh my butt off anytime John Cena was on screen. The actors had great chemistry also.Peter Farrelly can sure still make quality comedy films even if they are childish and crude. It's still pretty crazy to think the man who made this film won an Oscar for Best Picture.All in all I laughed a lot and John Cena is a national treasure. While not great in anyway still a funny movie if you want to laugh check it out."," Ricky Stanicky"
"191","Ricky Stanicky","MK-RatingsAndReviews","7/10","8 March 2024","When watching the scene at the bar with Wes and Dean, near the end of the movie. I felt like I missed something. Then in the next scene when Erin showed up to confront Dean, I definitely felt a little lost. I could feel that they cut down on Erin's storyline of her confirming her suspicions and handing over the story on Stanicky.Had there been a scene of the MBSNC confronting Stanicky and then quick cutting to the bar scene. That would have been enough to fill the logic gap of everything that comes at the viewer, following the bar scene. Still would have liked another scene of Erin investigating Stanicky to tie up any continuity stuff. Otherwise near perfect movie.Well pobody's nerfect, but this definitely makes the cut for being funny and sweet in a demented way. And by that I mean to say, I really enjoyed watching it. On a side note, Efron and Cena really seemed to have come up in the comedy game. Farrelly puts together a perfect cast and the movies antics and story hooks you right away.Would really like to rewatch this as an extended or directors cut. And were this 2014 maybe the bluray would have one. As it's 2024 and this film is paid for by prime member subscriptions, who can say if this will ever get an extended version, or a blu ray. But good Comedy's are the rarest of movie breeds and this is a good one."," Finished a little too quick for my liking. But Very Funny And Worth Your Time"
"192","Ricky Stanicky","ferguson-6","6/10","7 March 2024","Greetings again from the darkness. Honesty is the best policy. At least that's the lesson we were taught growing up. What we learn as we get older is that very few adhere consistently to that policy, and in fact, many pride themselves on an ability to mislead. On ""Seinfeld"", George Costanza stated quite succinctly, ""It's not a lie if you believe it."" Sadly, far too many are able to believe the web of lies they spread. But then, this film is from writer/director/producer Peter Farrelly, a double Oscar winner for GREEN BOOK (2020), and best known for the zany comedies he co-directed with his brother Bobby, including DUMB AND DUMBER (1994) and THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY (1998). If any filmmaker can make lying funny, it should be a Farrelly brother.The film starts where it should ... by showing us the childhood prank that led to the recurring lie. It's Halloween night and three buddies decide to prank the house that never gives out candy. The prank goes terribly wrong, and the imaginary Ricky Stanicky gets blamed, allowing our three young heroes to escape their first mess and setting the stage for 20 years of alibis. As adults, Dean (Zac Efron, fresh off his superb turn in THE IRON CLAW), JT (Andrew Santino), and Wes (Jermaine Fowler) continue to use their make-believe friend as a reason to take yet another boys' trip away from wives and partners and jobs and responsibilities. To ensure their stories stay straight, the men update ""the bible"", which is a chronology of the Stanicky lies they crafted over the years.The latest Stanicky tall tale involves cancer and a trip to Atlantic City for a concert ... a trip that allows JT to skip the baby shower his wife has planned. Circumstances being what they are, the trip is cut short, but before they leave, their paths cross with a hard-raunch celebrity impersonator with the stage name Rock Hard Rod (John Cena). Soon, the boys are calling Rod to play the role of Ricky Stanicky so that friends and family can meet the legend in the flesh. The rest of the movie involves the sometimes hilarious, sometimes not, shenanigans of Rod becoming Ricky Stanicky. As with most lies, things get more complicated and convoluted with each passing moment.""The best friend we never had"" becomes a complex challenge that threatens to ruin all relationships and careers. William H Macy plays Summerhayes, an old school businessman and boss to Dean and JT. Macy plays it straight here, but his 'air guitar' with an unfortunate Farrelly twist makes for a comical segment - as does Summerhayes' evolving thoughts on Stanicky, who by this time, has charmed (and tricked) all whom he's met and even cleverly overstepped at the Bris for JT's baby. Dean's wife Erin (Lex Scott Davis) is a reporter and sees Stanicky as her ticket to a better gig. It's a bit sad that Ms. Davis has the only female role with any substance here.Sir Walter Scott wisely commented, ""Oh, what a tangled web we weave."" Director Farrelly, working with a throwback comedy script from too many writers to name here, manages to find the humor in serial dishonesty, while also pointing out that the above-mentioned web is almost certain to nab the perpetrator(s) in the end. Farrelly also manages to check most of the PC boxes, while also showering us with his trademark inappropriateness. However, it's John Cena's energetic performance that shines here and keeps the film clicking along after a somewhat slow start. Cena proves he can carry a comedy.Available on Prime Video beginning March 7, 2024."," retro Farrelly and leading man Cena"
"193","Ricky Stanicky","olavoll","7/10","9 March 2024","15 years ago this would have been your average comedy but now in the age of depressive dramedies and unfunny pc comedies it ranks as one of the best...sadly. Finally I got to actually have a few laugh-out-loud moments while watching a comedy instead of crying a few tears during some of the recent horrible comedies.It has been some 10 years since they released a full length comedy with more than one lol scenes and to be honest this one is not even really that good when compared to the golden age of comedies from the 1980s up until late 2000s. OK, I must admit that Good Boys in 2019 was pretty funny and made for TV mockumentaries Tour de Pharmacy and 7 Days In Hell were really funny but these were huge exceptions.

"194","Ricky Stanicky","lisafordeay","5/10","10 March 2024","Ricky Stanicky is a 2024 comedy starring Zac Efron,Jermaine Fowler,Andrew Santino and John Cena. Directed by Peter Farrelly(who gave us Dumb and Dumber,Stuck On You and Theres Something About Mary alongside his brother Bobby),the story follows three childhood best friends who pull a prank that goes horribly wrong and they invent on another friend named ""Ricky Stanicky"" to avoid getting them out of trouble.Twenty years after creating Ricky, the three friends Dean, JT, and Wes (Efron, Santino, and Fowler) still use their fake friend Ricky as a handy alibi for their immature behaviors. When their spouses and partners get suspicious and demand to finally meet this Ricky Stanicky, the guilty trio decide to hire a washed-up actor and raunchy celebrity impersonator ""Rock Hard"" Rod (Cena) to bring him to life. But when Rod takes his role too far, they begin to wish they'd never invented Ricky in the first place.Will the duo come out clean to their spouses and friends? Overall it wasn't a bad film. I watched it solely for Zac Efron(who has changed an awful lot since The Greatest Showman due to facial reconstruction)and of course the director who gave us on of the funniest films of the decade Dumb And Dumber.5/10AVERAGE COMEDY."," Not as funny as Dumb And Dumber but it's still decent"
"195","Ricky Stanicky","imseeg","4/10","8 March 2024","Zac Efron and John Cena were the household names that made me check out this comedy. Right from the bat though I noticed one thing I did NOT like...The bad: it aint funny. Comedy is personal of course so let me not be to hastily in concluding that no one will be able to have a laugh with it, but I didnt laugh once.What it did make me do was cringe a lot. Why?More bad: this is such a cheaply made formulaic ""comedy"" which really brings nothing new to the table. It's NOT original. It's NOT fast. It's NOT even out of wack or quirky. How many ways are there to tell you this ""comedy"" didnt do anything for me?Even more bad: I guess they ran out of money for solid supporting actors, who are of B-movie level quality. BUT, even Zac Efron, who I like a lot as an actor, even he looked lost in this ""comedy"".Not a hit. Not a total flop either, but it comes close. So beware...."," How many ways are there to tell you that this movie is not funny?"
"196","Ricky Stanicky","eoinageary","6/10","20 March 2024","Absolutely ridiculous, I liked it.The story is of 3 childhood friends who create a friend named Ricky who takes the blame for anything they would get in trouble for, Ricky follows them into adulthood as they still use him to get out of things with their families. When Ricky must appear in person, the boys hire a crude actor from Atlantic city to play the role of Ricky.The movie is light, it's an easy watch for sure, the acting is good, some dialogue is patchy but overall fine.The jokes are quite funny, John Cena carries this movie his comedic timing is very good and his chemistry with anyone on screen is great. The 3 main friends are also good, such a random mix, the movie has a solid cast !!Silly comedy, sometimes that's needed, when your in that mood is recommended giving this a go, 6.5/10."," Silly Fun"
"197","Ricky Stanicky","rg79912","4/10","9 March 2024","I'll say it... this movie is crap...a flaming bag of lit dog crap. I watched for Zac Efron. Why Zac Efron why? This is up there with Dirty Grandpa. John Cena was great in this, which completely surprised me. The songs he sang got old reallyyy fast though. As an intro to his character, yeah it was funny. Having to endure it anywhere else later on in the movie was just painful. The other characters were boring tbh. Zac Efron was the only other okay character. This movie seems like it was written 2 decades ago. It just didn't connect, it seemed sloppy and not thought through. Decent idea, awful script, and someone just put ideas on a dart board and whatever they hit went into the movie. I checked how much was left 3x and wished it would go faster. I honestly only finished it for Zac Efron. It wasn't worth it. The dog scene was not okay. At all. I guess I don't have the sense of humor that thinks it's funny to watch two dogs going at it missionary for 2 minutes. It's gross. Maybe I'm a dog prude? Whatever but it soured the whole movie for me tbh. I won't comment on a certain actor's face, as I see in other reviews. I watched because I've liked his movies since Greatest Showman. Plus, I think he looks fine, but then I never found him attractive back in our younger days. This movie was just an easy paycheck though, clearly. Sad he took several steps back after working hard to show he was more than a bro character and finally being taken seriously. Anyways, don't let your kids watch it unless you want them watching like 8 minutes of John Cena singing about playing with himself and want to risk them singing those songs. Or the dog scene, please don't let them see that. My teen walked in while that scene was on and while he at first was all WTF?!? Once I told him what I was watching he laughed and was all, ""So...maybe less Zac Efron."" Agreed. No more blindly watching Zac Efron. Anyways, this movie is crap and 4 stars is generous. John Cena earned those stars from me by literally being willing to say or do anything for the money he made in this movie."," Unfunny 80% of the time, mildly funny 10% of the time, mildly touching 2% of the time, wtf?? 8% of the time."
"198","Ricky Stanicky","deloudelouvain","8/10","14 March 2024","By reading the very mixed reviews once again it's proven that comedies are difficult to rate as we all have a different sense of humour. What's funny to some sounds ridiculous to others and vice versa. I had a lot of fun watching Ricky Stanicky. Plenty of funny scenes, some even hilarious. Well maybe the wacky tabacky helped with that, but I really enjoyed this comedy. John Cena, that did about everything possible in entertainment, from bodybuilding, wrestling, singing and fashion also won me over as a comedian since Vacation Friends. He might not be the greatest actor but he has an eye for being in funny comedies. Andrew Santino, Zac Efron and John Cena made me laugh more than once, especially the scene with William H. Macy where he was airdicking. But I get it that some people might find that dumb humour, like I sometimes don't get other humour. I will for sure watch this movie again in the future, especially when I need some laughter."," Quit airdicking!"
"199","Ricky Stanicky","chand-suhas","4/10","11 March 2024","Dean, J. T. & Wes create the character of Ricky Stanicky, to escape from getting caught for their pranks and for twenty years they have kept using Ricky's name as an excuse to have some escapist fun and also get out of trouble. They use his name for a vacation in Atlantic City and also skip J. T's wife's baby shower. At Atlantic City, they run into an actor and an unique singer. Circumstances lead to them hiring him to pretend to be Ricky to convince their family members and give him the Bible of Ricky Stanicky to be the part. He overwhelms the trio of friends by being Ricky and being the friend they never had. How does Ricky impact the lives of the trio and will they be able to conceal his identity forms rest of the story.Peter Farrelly's comedy film is a boring affair, relying heavily on John Cena's dedication in play Ricky Stanicky and rest of the casts' energy simply doesn't match what John Cena brings into the table. It sticks to a mellow narrative which barely works for a comedy film and it doesn't even take much time for the film to start dragging. Sadly, Ricky Stanicky is that kind of film which instantly gets boring whenever the character Ricky is not on screen. The idea behind the story seems fun and noble considering the sentiments involved wrt being the one you can and supporting it with the humanitarian acts but all of it end up being highly superficial."," The best friend you never had!"
"200","Ricky Stanicky","TheBeardedWonder","4/10","7 March 2024","This movie is not funny, just straight up. The jokes are not funny and the only person who seems to be trying in the entire cast/crew is John cena. He's up for anything and truly the best part by far. I didn't think I'd ever say it but he deserves better cause he's honestly trying.The rest is a mishmash of other funnier plots and jokes and characters. Lots of them go nowhere and have nothing to do with anything. It was an excuse to do a dumb unfunny gag of some kind then it's over and has no bearing on the previous or next scene. Stuff just kinda happens and then the scene ends.You can skip this one, even for free it's not worth the time or slogging through..."," Not good"
