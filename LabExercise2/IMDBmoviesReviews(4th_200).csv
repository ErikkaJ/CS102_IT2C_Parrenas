This is such a unfunny comedy, i didn'tfind anything funny about this movie. The story is absolutely ridiculous, and far fetch Characters were annoying and unrelatable. I watched only because I wanted to see the aftermath of such a devious lie. How could any of these partners forgive such foolishness. Grown men that that keeps acting like boys don't want to grow up and handle any responsibilities. These men need therapy I need therapy after watching this. Why did I watch this foolishness."," So bad"
"2","Ricky Stanicky","cfdzwsr","9/10","10 March 2024","Fantastic movie from start to finish, John, zac and the rest of the crew were brilliant, zac did look a little out of place in a comedy movie at times.Would have been nice to see more of Gary Polisner (the dude playing the typical douche) as I believe he brought great comedic relief, had a dynamic entrance (with his $8000 watch) that he had on loan for the party, and he could have had more screen time with a little bit more of a back story.John Cena was at his absolute best again. Its easy to see why he is such a big draw card for viewers and i dare say majority of his lines were improvised.Overall its a brilliant, funny and laugh out loud movie..Well done."," Great to laugh out loud"
"3","Ricky Stanicky","powerguy-45731","9/10","14 March 2024","I was looking forward to see this movie as I Love John Cena and also Zac Efrons acting.It didnt disappoint, John did an amazing job and I was laughing alot. What a great character. He is so quick with the wit and a natural actor. WWE has definitely trained him well for an acting career. He is also a very likable guy and I liked him in this roleZac's character was played well and he was great in this role.The surprise were the other 2 actors who I wasn't familiar with. They were hilarious.The ending was predictable, but the rest of the movie was creative and funny.I was engaged the whole time."," Great Watch"
"4","Ricky Stanicky","merlintcs","9/10","12 March 2024","A lot of comedies today will ride the same jokes to death, rely on drawn out awkward moments, and overall fail to land half of their jokes. This movie has consistent quality, engaging and surprising content, and makes crass, inappropriate comedy without victimizing anyone. They also develop each of the main characters in a surprising and satisfying way. It would be nicer if the 2 white main friend characters were likeable, but they're really just one full character split into ""nice"" and ""mean"" characteristics.John Cena unsurprisingly steals and runs the show in the best way. He gets to do hilarious skits, show off impressions, do a million outfits changes including wigs and makeup, and make you bust up in the same sentence he makes you tear up."," Hilarious without going overboard"
"5","Ricky Stanicky","ayushja-55357","8/10","12 March 2024","Haven't finished the movie yet but John Cena is so funny in this movie, great actor and surprisingly different take on the same boring formulaic funny movie which is refreshing. Zac Efron and Andrew santino play a surprising bad guy duo who only care about them selves, I want Ricky stinicky to win cause f those other dudes. Which is a good thing because I'm invested till now, hope it stays good till the end. The most surprising thing is that it's not insufferable to watch like most comedy movies these days with some sort of ""message"" it's just a straight good ol funny movie with a good cast, can't ask for more."," You can't see me"
"6","Ricky Stanicky","gilbeys-13309","10/10","12 March 2024","Whole cast was funny. Acting was superb. Ricky was brought to life literally by John Cena. It helps that his body was hot and ripped.Zac Efron was great too. His character has a lot of flaws but he was able to redeem himself in the end.TJ's character was a bit too relaxed. If my son was going to be circumcised by a fraud I met at a casino, i would have stopped the whole thing and saved my son. This part does not make sense to me. He's a loving dad that would do anything for his son except save him from a possible life changing medical procedure.Wes' character seem the most chill. His two other friends and borderline neurotic but he's left out most of the time. They could have done more for his character.Joh Cena is the star. He really showed a lot of acting skills. His comedic timing was perfect and I went on an emotional ride with his character.Overall, fantastic movie. Highly recommended."," John Cena was fantastic"

"8","Ricky Stanicky","jayradano","8/10","13 March 2024","Not a great movie in terms of story, but that's not what it's trying to be. It's funny, cute and easy to watch. It's nice to have these kinda movies still around where I can put them on and not have to take notes to understand them and it's nice the movie is only about an hour n 45 minutes instead of these 2.5-3 hour plus movies of today. They hit the mark on this movie perfectly and Cena is the man!I've been saying it for a couple years now and I think most will finally agree, Cena is a better actor than Rock! He has much more range and can play any role in any movie and he's not afraid to make fun of himself. He truly made this movie that much better because of his wittty comedy and perfect comedic timing and delivery."," Just a fun easy watch! Cena was Great!!"
"9","Ricky Stanicky","nikkibnb-55459","9/10","9 March 2024","In the great spirit of Oscar Wilde, three friends create a fake fourth to blame for all their shenanigans. When they hire an actor to bring him to life to keep the lie going... hijinks ensue.Fun performances by John Cena, Zac Efron and. William H. Macy.A bit heavy handed on dick jokes, but the bit carries on so much it works. What it lacks in comic maturity, it makes up for with real laugh out loud moments. There are a few cringe-worthy moments that you'll have to forgive, but it all comes together in the end to serve up a funny story about friendship, truth-telling, and second chances. I really loved Ricky Stanicky."," Bunburying at its best!!"
"10","Ricky Stanicky","reelfan1111","9/10","9 March 2024","Step Brothers, 40 yr old Virgin, etc...those comedies that don't start out well received but then you realize all the memorable parts and one liners... keep rewatching till you memorize and then toss them out randomly when you're with a group of friends. I'm already singing, "" ooo baby I masturbate..every day"" and I've only seen it once.John Cena wss amazing, and every actor around him supported him well. He couldn't have been as outlandish if every other actor wasn't a little uptight. I even caught my self ""air dicking"" it yesterday. No wonder I don't get any respect. I really hope they make more movies like this, reminds me of the Happy Madison era.

"11","Ricky Stanicky","rayprasad","8/10","16 March 2024","While this is not going to be a ""critically-acclaimed film"" or one for the history books, it was an amazing film for its genre.I was shocked at how Cena took the starlight in this fun little adventure. This movie is filled with little twists, turns, and unexpected outcomes. There are a few scenes which had me laughing out loud, which is rare for me when watching more... modern day comedies.The humour can range from slapstick to witty to just laughing at the expense of a certain outcome or scenario. I can fully say that I did not expect to enjoy this movie whatsoever, but I found myself sticking to the screen and enjoying the script and writing of the characters.It was a non-serious, fun-filled adventure with Efron, Cena, and Santino, and if you enjoy or are in the mood for something that doesn't take too much thought or focus, I definitely would recommend this movie for some good laughs."," An 8 for this genre"
"12","Ricky Stanicky","ShloneN","4/10","15 March 2024","Was expecting this to be decent maybe 6/10 territory given the actors and director but was pretty shocked to find out there is actually no humor in this film.The main comedic effort would come from Cena, who plays an erotic singer but all he has to offer are bland wiener jokes. Maybe if I'd never seen a comedy or was 12 it would be funny but it's a huge miss for me now.The Kevin Heart movies on Netflix are actually funnier than this to give you an idea about how bad it is.Not sure what's happened to Farley since he was once a comedy great but this film was so safe and lame I'm shocked it came from him."," It's not funny. At all."
"13","Ricky Stanicky","stevehellboy","6/10","12 March 2024","This film was clearly trying ot add to the flow of Hollywood universal studio comedies.Although a lot of the jokes were missed enough landed for it to be mildly entertaining.Honestly it felt like a Bill Burr skit half the time.John Cena saved this movie as Zac Efron and his lesser known sidekick characters really sucked. The headline I put for this video said it all. Then Ginger Jewish guy is the most unlikeable character I have ever seen. He is very irratating and difficult to watch. The sarcastic undertones do not work and his overall performance lacked. His jokes weren't subtle at all."," Love John Cena but hate that ginger actor."
"14","Ricky Stanicky","christian_mcneal","7/10","11 March 2024","I'll be honest, the previews did not do it justice and i had zero desire to watch this even though i like dumb comedies. Till i saw that John Cena was in it as i have enjoyed him recently as he seems to have really started to come into his own and find his niche as a comedic actor. Plus any movie that has William H. Macy in it automatically has me sold on watching it. I am not saying this is a great movie, but that it is funny and that it will make you laugh and John Cena delivers the comedy but also makes you feel for his character. This is definitely a comedy that i could watch over and over."," Surprisingly funny"
"15","Ricky Stanicky","steveinrowg","7/10","14 March 2024","Few careers have achieved the proverbial heavyweight victory like John Cena's. Somehow achieving a different level of stardom, Cena has followed suit with others of his calibre, like Dwyane ""The Rock"" Johnson, another prime example of a shift in performing arts tracks that have struck gold. You've likely seen Cena in a variety of shows and movies over the last few years, and for good reason - he is a charasmatic comedic force, almost a household name.Joined by Zac Efron, Andrew Santino, and Jermaine Fowler, Amazon's Ricky Stanicky is a breath of freshness seldom enjoyed by much of today's ""bro comedies"". With personalities that clash and meld naturally, Efron, Santino, and Fowler all bring an air to this comedy that is both authentic and heartfelt. However, Cena's performance of who would become the titular Ricky Stanicky is clever and witty, yet boneheaded and silly. These forces combined with a premise centered around the reinvention of oneself in the face of an uncertain future builds this comedy into something with considerable heart.Comedy movies are hard to make - to make funny, that is. Comedy is subjective, and being funny for two hours requires a lot of quality material. That being said, while this movie was unique in its premise and execution, I found that they vied for some easy laughs when they could really have done better. This is all well and good - many folks' favorite comedies are ones where you don't speculate too much on usage of jokes and complexity of material - it's just something I felt held back Ricky Stanicky from being more.Laughter is medicine, and Ricky Stanicky is through and through a feel-good movie. Aside from the typical vulgarity of comedies of this credo, there are moments of genuine goodness that leave you with something a little more."," The Wrestler's New Groove"
"16","Ricky Stanicky","abdel-khaled31","9/10","10 March 2024","Ricky Stanicky"" is a delightful comedy that doesn't disappoint. With its clever premise and a stellar cast, including the charismatic John Cena as 'Rock Hard' Rod Aka Ricky Stanicky, the film delivers laughs aplenty. Cena's portrayal adds a unique flair to the story, bringing both humor and heart to his dual roles as Rod and the fictional character Ricky Stanicky. What sets this film apart is its exploration of the repercussions of a childhood prank that spirals out of control, leading to hilarious yet relatable situations. From start to finish, ""Ricky Stanicky"" keeps audiences engaged with its witty humor and endearing characters. Whether you're a fan of Cena or just in need of a good laugh, this movie is sure to entertain. Don't miss out on the fun!"," Best movie on 2024 so far"
"17","Ricky Stanicky","thevegastourist-01","9/10","11 March 2024","If you can get past the first 15 minutes of the movie, you will enjoy it. The first part is filled with social messaging and the mandatory diversity speeches. The three main men are cuckold and lack a spine (as expected).Its sad qwe need ot remind people of this: This is a movie, not a documentary. So, some things may not make sense in the real world, but this is a real comedy. There is something funny for just about everybody.Most of the leadign cast ar pe retty blah. And I never paid much attention to the actor John Cena before , but now I will. What an amazing talent. If it wasn't for him and Willaim Macy, the movie would have bombed completely.

It's just a comedy that's well acted and well written and fun to watch.John Cena us especially good in this role. He's hit several great scenes.The trailer tells the whole story - 3 childhood friends invent a fourth friend to blame for all of the trouble they get in. As adults, they get into a situation where they need their friends to show his face. Enter John Cena as Ricky Stanicky, and the movie jumps from awkward comedic even to awkward comedic scene and has a dose of heart thrown in.

After the first act, it compelled me to slowly chuckle and enjoy the ride. This type of movies aren't categorize as great cinema by public opinion, but i believe it has a merit. It had purpose, twists, decent cast and real funny and satisfying scenes. Story was more or less original, kind and pure. Maybe they could have explored it more whereas it didn't felt like a two-hours movie. It's a confident 8/10 for me only cause I had a great time watching it.

"22","Ricky Stanicky","ziyan-16981","8/10","10 March 2024","From the title and the cover had low expectation when started watching this movie but glad i chose to watch it. The story had a gradual progreassion not rushed or fast paced at all. The storyline was somewhat predictable but still funny none the less. Its a feel good comedy that Jhon cena elevated with his depiction of his charecter. Just my personal opinion, now that i have watched this, cant imagine anyone else playing Jhon cena's charecter which was goofy and likable. The movie does not go over the top with jokes and humor but the comedy is just enough to keep your attention focused on the story while still being funny and give the audiance a feel good experience.I would recomend this movie to anyone who is feeling a little down, bored or just want to watch something thats fun and wholesome. In summury This was a good watch, everyone should save this movie for a rainy day."," Fun enjoyable movie."
"23","Ricky Stanicky","bonzitre-67077","10/10","10 March 2024","It was a great movie. Super raunchy at times but hilarious laugh out loud. John Cena kills it and the rest of the cast shows up and does great. Expectations going in were extremely low, but out of the gate it quickly showed the personalities of the trio in a hilarious fashion. The laughs continued as they introduce John Cena's title character Ricky Stinkicky and what he does for a living. It was enjoyable enough I think they could have developed the movie a little more before the climax of the film because it kept giving sizable laughs along the way.Definitely not a family movie for kids but for some laughs, put it on and relax."," It's a raunchy hilarious heartwarming rollercoaster"

I know a lot of people will say it's awful and a waste of time & been there done that but I throughly enjoyed it and laughed quite a bit.Now while not being the best film obviously it's only a 6/10 but I couldn't help but laugh my butt off anytime John Cena was on screen. The actors had great chemistry also.Peter Farrelly can sure still make quality comedy films even if they are childish and crude. It's still pretty crazy to think the man who made this film won an Oscar for Best Picture.All in all I laughed a lot and John Cena is a national treasure.

"25","Ricky Stanicky","richardcaldarone","10/10","15 March 2024","Had no idea about this movie so there were no expectations. I found it hilarious from beginning to end... Cena played the part perfectly... plus the scenes shown of downtown providence makes it feel like it was shot there. I live in prov so i can tell you the shots are providence from where dean lives to the waterfront and even the business they work at are all real locations in providence. Humor reminds me of original farrelly bro movies... for some reason i especially kept thinkin of ""something about mary"".

Towards the end they really spin it into a nice redemption story, it's done well.Cena is impressive. He truly is a good comedic actor, and his self deprecating humor gives it a nice depth.I laughed several times.Was fun to see stand up comedians Andrew Santino and Jeff Ross in there, both on point.Zac Efron may ironically be the least convincing of all. Not sure what happened to his face but he lost all youthfulness and it was odd to see. He didn't do a bad job though, owing to the whole story hinging on him.Watch the credits until the end for an epic TikTok video."," Formulaic but surprisingly funny"

Three young boys are determined to prank a man who doesn't give out treats on Halloween, and things go real bad. As they flee, they drop a piece of clothing with the name Ricky Stanicky on it. As there is no such person they are not fingered for the fire. Ever since, they have used Ricky Stanicky as an excuse to get out of things they didn't want to do, saying they had to meet him for one thing or another. One day, they get tickets for a show at Atlantic City, but they should be at the one wife's baby shower. So along comes Ricky Stanicky with a need, so they go, and in AC, they meet this drunk who does obscene songs. He gives them his card. While they were in AC, his wife gives birth, so she is furious that he was not there, and demands to meet Ricky. So they contact the drunk, give him a book with ""Ricky's"" background, and hope he can pull it off. What they didn't realize is that he put his whole effort into becoming Ricky, and pulls it off in ways they didn't expect. As he told them, as an actor he throws himself into the character, and he did a lot of research. Then things get complicated, and that is part of the charm of the movie, and helps make the entire movie so charming and enjoyable. And yes, some clearly adult humor."," A lot of fun"

Some of the jokes fall short or even seem a little lame but Cena did a good job keeping this interesting and made me want to keep watching. I will say that Zac Efron wasn't too bad either and he's come along way since that Hairspray movie proving he can do more than just sing.

I hope that everyone involved is happy with this product, cause it made me happy.Obvious problems were mentioned earlier. You have to seriously forget how much tightrope walking that the characters have had to do (their whole lives) to make this whole thing happen.Good parts are that there is actually well written skits. John Cena is just ham enough to make the second main character and comic relief a true treat. There are jokes fired pretty rapidly if you sit back with this one.I liked it. If there is a switch in you that can turn off the ultra serious, watch this. If not, stay far away. This isn't an Oscar movie, and no one is Marlon Brando.

The cast matching was really great and it was cool to see Zac Efron alongside John Cena in this comedy. I put it on for just something casual to watch this afternoon but quickly found myself drawn into the story as the movie continued due to the great act and delivery by John. It was really funny and cool to see the Zany ways John portrayed Ricky and the movie is one I'd recommend to those who enjoy things like Freelance, 17 Again and The Hangover.

"34","Ricky Stanicky","cstahler-47698","8/10","7 March 2024","I went into Ricky Stanicky with an open mind but ultimately low expectations. Comedy movies just haven't been hitting the same as they used to, you know?Well, I thought I would stop watching about 20 minutes in, but kept going through because it grabbed my interest, once John Cena's character comes on screen though, I was fully sold and realized I'd be watching the movie all the way through, and I'm glad I did.Ricky Stanicky feels like a return to form for comedy movies, I would have seen this in theaters and likely invited friends to join me. It isn't perfect by any means and it requires you to take leaps of logical faith at times, but to me, comedy movies almost require a component of that, the best comedy movies for me are always just absurd and unlikely, like Joe Dirt. Maybe that's why I love this so much, there are parallels of a loveable loser doing the impossible with a pure heart.The core friend group is made of promising actors as well who do a good job, Zac Efron has a great history of solid comedy films, Jermaine Fowler was awesome in The Blackening, and Andrew Santino has a few solid comedic roles as well.However, the movie is really sold through Ricky/Rod's commitment and likability, when John Cena is on the screen, I'm locked in and typically laughing the hardest.John Cena's performance is a knock out for me. He's funny, he's interesting, he's admirable in certain ways, but he's so damn likable as Ricky Stanicky that I genuinely couldn't help but side with him despite all the red flags and the lunacy of the situation.The confrontation scene between him and Dean had me wondering how I would react in this absurd situation, I gave Dean a lot of flack during the scene, but I can't imagine reacting differently and to me that spoke volumes to Ricky for me.The humor is crass and gross at times while other times it'll surprise you with a joke that has a well made point.At the end of the day, I can truly say if I had seen this at 12, it probably would have been my favorite movie at the time and one I watched throughout the years. It is one I will probably pick up again, but only time will tell on that one."," A Fun & Ridiculous Ride"

"36","Ricky Stanicky","paulepath","9/10","8 March 2024","Peter Farrelly throws it back to the outrageous humor of his early days with Ricky Stanicky. This gleefully absurd comedy takes a simple premise - three friends invent a fake alibi named Ricky Stanicky - and runs wild with it.While the plot details remain under wraps, the film succeeds on the strength of its comedic performances. John Cena proves himself a comedic force to be reckoned with, injecting surprising charm into the titular role. The rest of the cast keeps pace, delivering Farrelly's signature brand of humor with perfect timing.Ricky Stanicky won't win awards for originality, but it doesn't shy away from pushing boundaries. Be prepared for some outrageous gags and plenty of cringe comedy. However, beneath the surface there's a surprising amount of heart. The film explores themes of friendship and loyalty in a way that feels genuine amidst the chaos."," Cringy, Grose, Stupid, Unbelievable but great"

This is up there with Dirty Grandpa. John Cena was great in this, which completely surprised me. The songs he sang got old reallyyy fast though. As an intro to his character, yeah it was funny. Having to endure it anywhere else later on in the movie was just painful. The other characters were boring tbh. Zac Efron was the only other okay character. This movie seems like it was written 2 decades ago. It just didn't connect, it seemed sloppy and not thought through. Decent idea, awful script, and someone just put ideas on a dart board and whatever they hit went into the movie. I checked how much was left 3x and wished it would go faster. I honestly only finished it for Zac Efron. It wasn't worth it. The dog scene was not okay. At all. I guess I don't have the sense of humor that thinks it's funny to watch two dogs going at it missionary for 2 minutes. It's gross. Maybe I'm a dog prude? Whatever but it soured the whole movie for me tbh. I won't comment on a certain actor's face, as I see in other reviews. I watched because I've liked his movies since Greatest Showman. Plus, I think he looks fine, but then I never found him attractive back in our younger days. This movie was just an easy paycheck though, clearly. Sad he took several steps back after working hard to show he was more than a bro character and finally being taken seriously. Anyways, don't let your kids watch it unless you want them watching like 8 minutes of John Cena singing about playing with himself and want to risk them singing those songs. Or the dog scene, please don't let them see that. My teen walked in while that scene was on and while he at first was all WTF?!? Once I told him what I was watching he laughed and was all, ""So...maybe less Zac Efron."" Agreed. No more blindly watching Zac Efron. Anyways, this movie is crap and 4 stars is generous. John Cena earned those stars from me by literally being willing to say or do anything for the money he made in this movie."," Unfunny 80% of the time, mildly funny 10% of the time, mildly touching 2% of the time, wtf?? 8% of the time."

Directed by Peter Farrelly(who gave us Dumb and Dumber,Stuck On You and Theres Something About Mary alongside his brother Bobby),the story follows three childhood best friends who pull a prank that goes horribly wrong and they invent on another friend named ""Ricky Stanicky"" to avoid getting them out of trouble.Twenty years after creating Ricky, the three friends Dean, JT, and Wes (Efron, Santino, and Fowler) still use their fake friend Ricky as a handy alibi for their immature behaviors. When their spouses and partners get suspicious and demand to finally meet this Ricky Stanicky, the guilty trio decide to hire a washed-up actor and raunchy celebrity impersonator ""Rock Hard"" Rod (Cena) to bring him to life. But when Rod takes his role too far, they begin to wish they'd never invented Ricky in the first place.Will the duo come out clean to their spouses and friends? Overall it wasn't a bad film. I watched it solely for Zac Efron(who has changed an awful lot since The Greatest Showman due to facial reconstruction)and of course the director who gave us on of the funniest films of the decade Dumb And Dumber.5/10AVERAGE COMEDY."," Not as funny as Dumb And Dumber but it's still decent"

Then in the next scene when Erin showed up to confront Dean, I definitely felt a little lost. I could feel that they cut down on Erin's storyline of her confirming her suspicions and handing over the story on Stanicky.Had there been a scene of the MBSNC confronting Stanicky and then quick cutting to the bar scene. That would have been enough to fill the logic gap of everything that comes at the viewer, following the bar scene. Still would have liked another scene of Erin investigating Stanicky to tie up any continuity stuff. Otherwise near perfect movie.Well pobody's nerfect, but this definitely makes the cut for being funny and sweet in a demented way. And by that I mean to say, I really enjoyed watching it. On a side note, Efron and Cena really seemed to have come up in the comedy game. Farrelly puts together a perfect cast and the movies antics and story hooks you right away.Would really like to rewatch this as an extended or directors cut.

I don't know that Ricky Stanicky particularly stands out, but it got several chuckles and a few full-laughs, there was a heartfelt ending, and it kept me entertained. Somewhere between a Judd Apatow film and Happy Madison. An 8 star rating is generous, but I'm considering how ""I Love You Man"" was overlooked and how many of these types of movies have suffered from either leaning too hard into the romance/drama, or veering off into impossible slapstick.

"49","Ricky Stanicky","ferguson-6","6/10","7 March 2024","Greetings again from the darkness. Honesty is the best policy. At least that's the lesson we were taught growing up. What we learn as we get older is that very few adhere consistently to that policy, and in fact, many pride themselves on an ability to mislead. On ""Seinfeld"", George Costanza stated quite succinctly, ""It's not a lie if you believe it."" Sadly, far too many are able to believe the web of lies they spread. But then, this film is from writer/director/producer Peter Farrelly, a double Oscar winner for GREEN BOOK (2020), and best known for the zany comedies he co-directed with his brother Bobby, including DUMB AND DUMBER (1994) and THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY (1998). If any filmmaker can make lying funny, it should be a Farrelly brother.The film starts where it should ... by showing us the childhood prank that led to the recurring lie. It's Halloween night and three buddies decide to prank the house that never gives out candy. The prank goes terribly wrong, and the imaginary Ricky Stanicky gets blamed, allowing our three young heroes to escape their first mess and setting the stage for 20 years of alibis. As adults, Dean (Zac Efron, fresh off his superb turn in THE IRON CLAW), JT (Andrew Santino), and Wes (Jermaine Fowler) continue to use their make-believe friend as a reason to take yet another boys' trip away from wives and partners and jobs and responsibilities. To ensure their stories stay straight, the men update ""the bible"", which is a chronology of the Stanicky lies they crafted over the years.The latest Stanicky tall tale involves cancer and a trip to Atlantic City for a concert ... a trip that allows JT to skip the baby shower his wife has planned. Circumstances being what they are, the trip is cut short, but before they leave, their paths cross with a hard-raunch celebrity impersonator with the stage name Rock Hard Rod (John Cena). Soon, the boys are calling Rod to play the role of Ricky Stanicky so that friends and family can meet the legend in the flesh. The rest of the movie involves the sometimes hilarious, sometimes not, shenanigans of Rod becoming Ricky Stanicky. As with most lies, things get more complicated and convoluted with each passing moment.""The best friend we never had"" becomes a complex challenge that threatens to ruin all relationships and careers. William H Macy plays Summerhayes, an old school businessman and boss to Dean and JT. Macy plays it straight here, but his 'air guitar' with an unfortunate Farrelly twist makes for a comical segment - as does Summerhayes' evolving thoughts on Stanicky, who by this time, has charmed (and tricked) all whom he's met and even cleverly overstepped at the Bris for JT's baby. Dean's wife Erin (Lex Scott Davis) is a reporter and sees Stanicky as her ticket to a better gig. It's a bit sad that Ms. Davis has the only female role with any substance here.Sir Walter Scott wisely commented, ""Oh, what a tangled web we weave."" Director Farrelly, working with a throwback comedy script from too many writers to name here, manages to find the humor in serial dishonesty, while also pointing out that the above-mentioned web is almost certain to nab the perpetrator(s) in the end. Farrelly also manages to check most of the PC boxes, while also showering us with his trademark inappropriateness. However, it's John Cena's energetic performance that shines here and keeps the film clicking along after a somewhat slow start. Cena proves he can carry a comedy.Available on Prime Video beginning March 7, 2024."," retro Farrelly and leading man Cena"

Once this black screen makes way we are introduced to Rudolf and Hedwig Höss and their family as they enjoy a sun drenched picnic in the countryside. Rudolf Höss was the longest-serving commandant of Auschwitz concentration and extermination camp. Rudolf and Hedwig have their family home next to Auschwitz seemingly living their best normal life just feet away from the atrocities taking place nearby. In this house they have nice furnishings, a swimming pool and beautiful flowers in a picturesque garden. The couple are not always self aware that they are monsters as they parade themselves as if conducting purely normal duties, Hedwig particularly proud of being ""Queen of Auschwitz"". The sound design is outstanding as the events over the wall are detailed with a subtlety which is very realistic and distressing. This film is one I won't rewatch on many occasions as it was clearly a disturbing story which was directed with great detail. The background scenes of smoke billowing in the distance and trains arriving add to the horrific nature set against the innocence of the young children who live next door.

"53","The Zone of Interest","SoumikBanerjee1996","8/10","9 March 2024","The medium of 'Cinema' is widely recognized as a means of visual storytelling, where a series of moving images move the narrative forward, with background sound playing a secondary role. However, there are instances where the audio takes control of the sequences and defies conventionality.Jonathan Glazer's ""The Zone of Interest"" serves as a prime example of this phenomenon. The director skilfully employs a variety of sounds, such as the constant arrivals of trains, gunshots, and the burning of chimneys, creating an atmosphere that is undeniably terrifying.Whilst there are a few noteworthy cinematographic elements, including effective use of juxtaposition, it is the background score and sound design that bear the brunt of the storytelling.For those interested in watching this film in the comfort of their homes, I would personally recommend finding the quietest possible environment, utilizing proper sound systems or headphones (preferably noise-canceling ones), and try to watch the entire thing in one sitting, without interruptions.Trust me, this approach will significantly enhance your perception of the film.However, it is important to note that the film heavily relies on visual as well as auditory 'insinuations,' such as suggestive sounds and framings, to convey its message. As a result, individuals who are might be unfamiliar with historical events, particularly those lacking knowledge of ""The Holocaust,"" may struggle to grasp these subtleties.In essence, it is not a readily accessible feature for all viewers out there.

Then there are films that are excellent, but you never want to see them again, and they are very hard to recommend.The Zone Of Interest falls into the latter part of that sentence.It's a remarkable film, with a hideous backdrop. The Hoss family are living a subliminal suburban life, with an idyllic house, servants, and the kids have a wonderful education. But, they happen to live right next to Auschwitz.Glazer is a phenomenal film maker, and whilst I didn't like Under The Skin, the guerilla film making in that movie was genius, and here, he puts cameras in different places in the house and turns it to impromptu performance from the cast. Obviously not all of it is impromptu, but it's a Marvel turn from Glazer, and it makes the film feel more real.But then as the film progresses, the background becomes the main character, and much like the Hoss family, there is no getting away from the fact that diabolical things are happening beyond the eye.And this turns the idyllic life for the family into something else. Are they ignorant? Are they Embarrassed? Or are they as monstrous as the beasts that are working in the camp?So, as I've already said, it's a remarkable piece of work, with some shocking sequences (the scene at the river is grotesque), but like Come And See, it's really hard to recommend, and I have no desire to see it again."," The life we enjoy is very much worth the sacrifice....."

The way in which the commandant family is shown living their normal life when human being are being burnt alive just feet away will surely give you chills.Sandra Hüller gives yet another thrilling performance after Anatomy of a Fall (also nominated for Oscars). Playing the commandant's wife Hedwig she portrays a cold and ruthless lady so consumed in her own world that she's completely ignorant towards the noises and smoke from the furnaces of these extermination camps.This Glazer's epic deserves recognition and it's about time the Oscars reward one of, if not the most, audacious films of the year."," Unlike anything before"

How did the nazis gat away with it for so long?This film shows in part why, how Auschwitz and the camps around it provided a lifestyle for some German families. How the horrors that went on were ignored and excused and although people knew, they didn't question.Unlike other, similar films, this has a very cold feel to it. As life with the family goes on like any other family, you see or hear glimpses of the horrors continually taking place, but these are not at the forefront of daily life, this is just background noise to the families other issues, the contrast is starkI don't think this movie is for everyone, it's not action packed and lacks the Hollywood feel many will want, but it depicts an important image, one which everyone should see, but not to understand."," If you ever wondered 'how did they get away with it...."""

I have to applaud the filmmakers for showing the unimaginable horrors of the hollocaust without actually showing it. Instead, we follow the family of Rudolf Höss, the man in charge of the Auschwitz concentration camp, and how they go about their daily lives. They live in a spatious home, with a beautiful garden that happens to be located right next to the concentration camp. Like one of their garden walls is literally the prison wall. Throughout the movie, we never catch a look insight of the camp walls, but while the children enjoy a summer day in the family pool, we hear the occasional shots in the background throughout the movie. We hear screams of prisoners and guards alike. And of course, we see the constant flames and the smoke coming out of the ovens in which the bodies of thousands of people are turned to ashes. It creates a surreal but captivating atmosphere of happy family life right next to torture and death, that they are in a major part responsible for. The only criticism that I have is that the movie doesn´t really have a plot that advances the story, so it just becomes 100 minues of drawing out the same idea.

Those initial concerns about pacing soon disappeared as I found myself horrified by the juxtaposition of the uncaring, brutal mundanity of the Commandant's family life just outside the camp, and the unimaginable, unseen horrors that were happening literally metres away inside the camp.

"59","The Zone of Interest","PEEZYEM","8/10","12 March 2024","Holocaust-themed films have consistently been a pivotal element of global cinema. They navigate through the darkest facets of humanity while simultaneously unveiling the most noble aspects of the human spirit. Whether showcasing the harrowing depths or the commendable heights of human conduct, these stories leave a lasting impact, garnering accolades and serving as a poignant reminder of a past that horrifies yet inspires.Jonathan Glazer's ""The Zone Of Interest"" distinguishes itself within this genre; No other film has so incisively captured the mundane nature of evil. Despite the atrocities occurring just beyond view, audible yet distant, the film presents a narrative deeply rooted in the day-to-day that feels eerily familiar.It weaves in everyday life events - from sibling rivalries and heartfelt mother-daughter conversations to chance encounters with man's best friend and brushes with authoritative bosses. These vignettes resonate with anyone familiar with the nuances of everyday life, setting a profound contrast against the backdrop of evil's banality.The performances by Sandra Hüller and Christian Friedel are nothing short of remarkable. However, their brilliance is subtly masked, as Glazer maintains a deliberate distance throughout the film. This artistic choice fosters a connection to the mundane aspects of daily life while preventing the audience from becoming overly attached to the underlying evil of the presented characters. This sense of commonality is skillfully juxtaposed with the stark contrasts of the film's setting, underscored by a haunting soundtrack orchestrated by Mica Levi and her team.The film's power is amplified by a resonant tie between past and present, culminating in the final scenes. It serves as a chilling reminder that the past, though distant, remains profoundly relevant."," The banality of evil."

That's by design, of course, but there were aspects of it that had me at a loss. There's a particularly experimental decision it returns to a couple of times where things are shown using a thermal camera, and I didn't know what was being communicated there. Maybe that's on me being a dummy, but I felt fairly sure of what the rest of the film was trying to say. At a point, you do wonder how it could even end, and the final couple of scenes are unexpected, but I thought that was a strange direction to go in that worked. There are a couple of points earlier that had me bewildered, but that's sort of what you expect from Jonathan Glazer; the guy made Under the Skin, after all.It's certainly worth watching The Zone of Interest, and I do expect parts of it to stick with me. It tackles difficult subject matter in a detached and grim way that before today, I'd only really seen in documentaries (I'm reminded most of Shoah and the more recent The Act of Killing when watching The Zone of Interest; I guess the latter even has a similar-sounding title, now that I think about it). It's hard to know what to think overall, and giving this a rating out of five or ten feels hard as well. But I respect what it's going for, and generally understand it. This is a difficult film about difficult things, and that it was difficult to watch throughout (and kind of difficult to understand in a couple of key moments) is, perhaps, the point."," Journey into the unknown."

"63","The Zone of Interest","spencermcook","8/10","2 February 2024","By depicting the ordinary lifestyle of Rudolf Höss (the longest-serving commandant of Auschwitz) and his family living within an arm's reach of Auschwitz, Jonathan Glazer has found a way to depict evil unlike anything I've ever seen. As horror films enhance the eeriness of their stories, ""The Zone of Interest"" showcases an abundance of audio-visual moments that are entirely discomforting and piercingly complementary to the feeling that Glazer is aiming to provoke from audience members. This is a point-of-view story that the world isn't accustomed to witnessing, and that's exactly what harnesses the pit that sits deeply inside your stomach while watching. Though the events of this film take place 80 years ago, the contentment and indifference to cruelty and inhumanity are parallel to current issues that many of us choose to ignore simply because we don't want to look. This is a cinematic experience that binds reality as close as possible, and though unconventional and off-putting in its film style, it's hard to argue against this being the most original piece of filmmaking from 2023."," Evil depicted in the most subtly powerful manner"
"64","The Zone of Interest","WooderIce64","8/10","5 March 2024","The Holocaust is a difficult thing to deal with in any medium, film included. The Zone of Interest is something rather rare, a movie about the Holocaust from the Nazi perspective. That's not to say it takes their side, it very much does the opposite. This is a movie about one man who was instrumental in the daily functioning of the death machine; Rudolph Hoss, commandant of Auschwitz, and his family as they work to create a home for themselves adjacent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. In simplest terms, this is the day to day lives of the people responsible for the atrocities.Minimalism is key here - there is very little dialogue, very little music, and the interior of the camp does not appear at all in the main story. Irrespective of what it provokes in audiences, there is very little emotion portrayed. There isn't even that much of a story, even in its fairly short runtime. It also has a certain claustrophobic rigidity. You can count on one hand the number of times the camera moves. While this is a movie with a strong message, it is not explicitly delivered or spelled out at all. Deciphering this film is closer to analyzing a painting than a more standard movie. It can be quite daunting.Ultimately, The Zone of Interest is about two things - normalization and detachment. Popular culture, back then and now, oftentimes depicts Nazis as these sort of cartoonish, comic book-esque villains. This is a film that reminds us that they were no less human than you or I. They had the same worries that many of us have - family drama, job promotion, etc. That's not to say it's trying to make excuses or anything - they know exactly what's going on. The disturbing elements of the movie are no so much as the gunshots and crematoriums in the background, but the normalcy with which it is treated.There are also several surreal sequences in this movie, and their meaning is particularly difficult to discern. For instance, the scene where the entire screen turns red. The movie opens with a solid minute of a blank, black screen. Some scenes are filmed in negative. These are kind of a deterrent, in a way not. They do break up the monotony, but the monotony is the point of the movie. The ending of the movie is... disturbing, to say the least. It feels like a horror movie scene with an inevitable jumpscare that doesn't come.The Zone of Interest is a unique film, that's for certain. Your mileage may vary. If you know what you're getting in to, then you may find some appreciation for this unusual vision."," Minimalism is Key"
"65","The Zone of Interest","scarlettbradford","8/10","3 March 2024","So... I completely agree with the reviews that say this movie is boring and lacks plot. It was tedious and felt like a chore to watch to be honest, but I think therein lies its brilliance. It felt like trying to meditate on those days when your mind is filled with feral cats. Other holocaust movies made me weep at human cruelty and loss, but this film does not provide that emotional catharsis. In its mundanity, it just forces you to sit in discomfort with nowhere to release the feelings. And shouldn't we feel that way that humanity perpetrated such horrors upon itself and frequently continues to despite having this lesson to teach us better? I want to visit the lynching museum in Montgomery, AL as well as Auschwitz one day and I know both will make me feel awful. One doesn't go to those places for fun or entertainment. One goes to bear witness in the hopes of learning and understanding. It's work. So I think this film is brave in forcing work without traditional plot devices and crescendos and valleys. To just deliver to anxious discomfort and sit in it."," I think tedious discomfort may be the point"
"66","The Zone of Interest","meclote","8/10","28 February 2024","The film emerges as a masterful cinematic exploration of the darkest recesses of human nature, presenting a narrative that is as unsettling as it is enlightening. This film dares to confront the uncomfortable truth about the normalization of atrocities within the human psyche, delivering a powerful commentary on the cruelty and individualism that can pervade human actions. Through its unflinching portrayal of life amidst one of history's greatest horrors, it forces viewers to reckon with the depth of human evil, asking, ""How far can the evil human go?"" The answer, as depicted with chilling clarity in this film, is profoundly disturbing.The performances by Christian Friedel and Sandra Hüller, as Rudolf Höss and Hedwig Höss respectively, are nothing short of phenomenal. Friedel's portrayal of Rudolf Höss is chilling, capturing the essence of a man embroiled in unspeakable evil with a terrifying detachment. Hüller, as Hedwig, embodies the smug arrogance of her unofficial title, ""Queen of Auschwitz,"" with a performance that is guaranteed to provoke a visceral reaction from the audience. Their performances bring to life the chilling reality of those who lived in the shadows of atrocity, offering a raw, unvarnished look at their characters' inhumanity.""The Zone of Interest"" also reignites the debate over the portrayal of Holocaust atrocities in media, questioning the fine line between commemoration and exploitation. By focusing on the perpetrators, the film takes a bold step in Holocaust representation, ensuring that the discussion around these narratives remains both relevant and contentious. However, it makes strides to include Jewish testimony, with a poignant coda set in the modern-day Auschwitz museum.The film's conclusion is a stark reminder of the necessity to remember and condemn the figures responsible for such horrors, ensuring they remain condemned in the darkness of history. ""The Zone of Interest"" is a compelling, thought-provoking piece that does not shy away from the complexities of its subject matter. It is a film that demands to be seen, not only for its artistic merits but for its potent reminder of the depths to which humanity can sink and the collective responsibility to remember and learn from the past."," Navigating Humanity's Darkest Chapters"
"67","The Zone of Interest","cricketbat","8/10","23 February 2024","Despite its seemingly mundane foreground, The Zone of Interest kept me thoroughly engaged (and horrified) by what was going on in the background. This film uses sound and visual clues to continuously echo the terrible events that occurred at the Auschwitz concentration camp without overtly saying anything. The cameras keep their distance from the characters, giving a heightened sense of realism to the story, as if you were watching the events unfold in person. I don't think I'll be watching The Zone of Interest again any time soon, but it definitely made an impression on me that I won't soon forget."," The foreground is mundane, the background is horrifying"
"68","The Zone of Interest","xgokhan","8/10","23 February 2024","This movie is exactly what I hoped it to be in many ways. A truly objective look at a horrible time in history. But a time where a manority of people still led close to normal lives, or if not, normalized what they were going through.So to assume that a portrayal of a family linked to the genocide by Nazis had to show them as inhuman monsters with foaming mouths and psychotic behavior is irrational. If you were to be transported back in time and were a fly on the wall of that house, I am certain yu would observe something quite similar to this. This does not take away from the movie's striking power.In fact, the mundaneness and the banality of this family's life and the way they normalize living on the other side of a deadly concentration camp while acting like a normal family - whatever normal means - is what makes it terrifying. Had this family been depicted as a bunch of people who talk about how much they hate Jews and how they should all be rid of nonstop, this would be shoving a message down our throat and would not sit well.Also the many reviews asking about where the other half of the story is, and why the camp behind the wall isn't shown. Sometimes what's not obvious is scarier. It is not like we do not know what happened there, and there is no reason to add more grueling scenes to score drama points and it is much more telling to leave that to the imagination of the viewer. The sound effects do that brilliantly.The only criticism I would have is - despite understanding what Glazer was trying to do - to the night vision scenes which, despite trying to add a positive side to the story, ended up seeming disjointed to me."," A snapshot"
"69","The Zone of Interest","kabbauddo","8/10","23 February 2024","The plot itself is a very simple and even beautiful daily life of a family. However, when all this happens outside the concentration camp, it shows an indescribable and huge contrast. The protagonist's family played amid the wailing sounds, planted flowers in the thick black smoke, and swam in the river with scattered bones. It's so unsettlingly depressing and terrifying that the false peace they try to maintain as a family seems inexplicably absurd and ridiculous. Previous films about the Nazis and concentration camps have mostly put the audience in the perspective of the victims, but this film gives us a glimpse into daily life in Germany during that era, and the story just takes place outside Auschwitz. As for how the characters in the film should be judged, that's a matter of opinion."," The suffocatingly absurd"

Who thought a foreign language, holocaust film was the right place to laugh hysterically between themselves, talk non stop and throw things at each other for the entire film.That aside thought this is one of the best films I've ever seen that I'll probably never watch again. It's so brutally effective in every way to the point where almost every shot is designed to make you feel uncomfortable in some way. It's got maybe the best use of sound I've heard from a 2023 movie (yes I do remember Oppenheimer) and it constantly left me confused about how to feel in all the right ways.It's really hard to make a good Holocaust movie because they all really need to have something unique to say about these horrific events. But I can honestly say The Zone of Interest is one of the best films I've seen in this genre.

"71","The Zone of Interest","thomashealydavies","8/10","22 February 2024","There is little to discuss when it comes to plot and character development. But that is not what this film is about. It explores how evil human beings can be to each other and still find time to do the mundane everyday life things that we need to do. How we can become so inhuman, like robots, with our everyday, when such unspeakable brutality is happening next door.The framing is excellent. Every shot is still, like the viewer is unable to move either from fear or sheer disbelief. The sound is equally disturbing, from distance screams and sporadic gunfire to deep, soul disturbing bass.It must have been so hard to end this film. So a flash forward to the cleaners was thought provoking. No matter how much cleaning we do we will never remove this stain from humanity. As we move forward as a civilisation it is important to not forget these atrocities, but I think it is more important to reflect on our own species' capabilities rather than finger point. Modern day Germans also consider the Nazis the bad guys. They too were people. Led by evil leaders and brainwashed by propaganda. This film shows us the normality of that life, playing with the kids, eating, enjoying the weather in the garden.

"72","The Zone of Interest","masonsaul","8/10","6 February 2024","The Zone of Interest is the mundanity of evil taken to its most horrifying extreme. A film that makes intentions very clear from the beginning and then spends the next 105 minutes reinforcing that point in a harrowing fashion. It's a nightmare in cinematic form.Sandra Hüller and Christian Friedel are so good at portraying the selfishness and desensitisation of their characters. Their performances are designed to be very boring as they focus on the mundane tasks directly in front of them and completely block out everything on the other side of that fence.Jonathan Glazer's direction wisely keeps everything visually bleak and at a distance. Every shot is meticulously precise and the night vision sequences further emphasise the almost quotidian nature. Mica Levi's score is only very briefly present but whenever it's there it's unforgettable in how haunting it is.The most vital part of why this film works is definitely the sound design by Johnnie Burn. It's a soundscape which is constantly reminding you of what's going on over that fence and creating a dissonance between what you're seeing and what you're hearing that's deliberately uncomfortable."," Haunting experience"
"73","The Zone of Interest","jaysonpajaronvistal","8/10","24 February 2024","""Zone of Interest"" undertakes a chilling examination of the Holocaust, using the lack of empathy as a key focus to construct a compelling horror story that explores the idea of the ""Banality of Evil."" Directed by Glazer, the film distinguishes itself through its unique narrative approach, pushing against stereotypical storytelling. The lack of empathy becomes the true antagonist, creating an atmosphere that is both disturbing and thought-provoking.The movie cleverly portrays the lives of seemingly ""ordinary"" people, creating an illusion of eavesdropping on their existence while simultaneously highlighting the brutal and horrifying nature of their complicity in horrendous acts. This juxtaposition creates a discomforting tension that permeates the entire film.Unlike other Holocaust films, ""Zone of Interest"" refrains from explicit exposition, relying instead on subtle elements like sound design and terrifying dialogues to convey the horror of the events. The decision to withhold explicit visuals adds to the film's effectiveness, allowing the audience's imagination to fill in the blanks and intensify the emotional impact.A standout feature is the film's exceptional sound design, which masterfully balances heaviness with subtlety. The terrifying acts are conveyed through sound, heightening the impact without relying on graphic visuals. This careful use of audio elements contributes significantly to the overall atmosphere of horror.The film's strength lies in its ability to evoke a sense of horror not through overt violence, but through the emotional detachment and indifference exhibited by its characters. It highlights the dangers of indifference and the repercussions of being an accomplice, providing a powerful and stirring reflection through film.The movie's only drawback is that it may not appeal to everyone due to its slow and occasionally dragging execution. This approach might hinder some viewers from fully comprehending or understanding the film. However, it's understandable given this deliberate pacing. For those with a passion for storytelling, ""Zone of Interest"" has the potential to captivate and engage.In conclusion, ""Zone of Interest"" serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of apathy and complicity, making it a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant cinematic experience."," ""Zone of Interest"" effectively captures the essence of Hannah Arendt's concept of the ""Banality of Evil,"" creating an atmosphere that is both disturbing and thought-provoking."

The movie The Zone of Interest, a highly modified adaptation of the book, allows us all the stark reminder that there is little theoretical limit to the utter destruction and senselessness we can inflict when we believe ourselves, and convince others, that our way of life, our existence, depends on wholesale, profitable slaughter.It would be a horrifying experience to simply listen to the devastatingly sincere and painstakingly researched soundtrack, expertly and deftly edited to accompan the otherwise pleasantly scenic imagery, whether spring, summer, winter, or fall. If nothing else, The Zone of Interest confronts the audience to manifest its own considerations, such as what would we have done had we been there then with the freedom to help another life live, whether friend, family, foe, or other.Although such movies make us uncomfortable and we might think of ourselves as better than the villains of history and now, it can be small acts of complacency which aggregate and feed the bloodthirsty machinery of destruction, conquest, and irrational hate. We will unfortunately continue to need these reminders as long as we convince ourselves that we are better than others."," A reminder we continue to need"

"76","The Zone of Interest","ethanbresnett","6/10","29 January 2024","The Zone of Interest takes a unique angle in approaching the Holocaust. Certainly an angle I haven't seen before in a film. This different approach gives the film a really sinister quality that frames the evils of the Holocaust in a new and terrifying way.It achieves this approach through stark juxtaposition. It compares the relatively banal, matter-of-fact homemaking of the Hoss family against the utterly horrendous tragedy being perpetrated just over their garden wall. By doing this, it is not an overly graphic or in your face film. Instead, the violence and evil is primarily heard and not seen, as the horrifying sounds of the camp constantly bleed into the Hoss family home. It is in this way that the film makes its mark. To have such tragedy and horror ignored by this family and their guests. To normalise the mass murder over the garden wall. The glib and matter of fact way it is treated by them all. That is where the horror lies.Whilst this is all a very effective way of framing the horrors of the Holocaust, I do think this film lacks any storytelling merit. There is no real plot to speak of, so once the point the film is making has been made it is easy to want it to be over so as not to sit with these evil characters and horrendous events for too long.Then again it is a tricky point because I think this is definitely a story worth telling. Looking at the Holocaust from this angle to understand how normalised it became to certain people is vital to reflect on, but I'm not sure if a feature film was necessary to convey this.So overall, I thoroughly appreciate what this film was doing and the angle it took. The direction is class in creating this juxtaposition and drilling this point home, but beyond it's core message there is nothing in this film to get stuck into. No real plot. No characters you want to understand or connect with. As a result it feels like it overextended itself as a film, but delivers it's message nonetheless."," Impactful but drawn out"
"77","The Zone of Interest","evanston_dad","9/10","17 January 2024","This movie gave me the shivers in a big way.I don't even know how to articulate my thoughts on this film. I didn't really think it was possible to show me a story about the Holocaust that felt like something I hadn't already seen, but Jonathan Glazer manages to do just that with this film. I tried to read the Martin Amis novel this is based on and got almost all the way through it, but I bailed with about 50 or so pages to go. Just couldn't force myself through that last bit. But I read enough of it to know that the film is a very loose adaptation. It's more like Glazer took the general idea and then made his own story out of it.I had just watched ""All the Light We Cannot See"" shortly before seeing this film, and I was so irritated in that series that the Nazis were all portrayed as such cartoonish villains. Every single one was a ghoulish monster who monologued while terrorizing whoever they happened to be in the room with. My problem with that is that it makes the Nazis look like aberrations rather than as normal people who were somehow brainwashed into thinking that what they were doing was on the right side of history, so it's easy to dismiss the Holocaust as something that couldn't happen again. But in ""The Zone of Interest,"" Glazer does the exact opposite. The Nazis in this are banal, ordinary people who tend their gardens, bicker about the things spouses bicker about, spend the day bathing in the river with their kids. It just so happens that literally outside their backyard is daily mass murder which they can conveniently ignore because it's out of sight. We hear the screams, gunshots, the trains bringing in fresh batches of people to be slaughtered, but we don't ever see it. The film creates a portrait of the most banal kind of evil, and it's hard for me to get my head around it.Christian Friedel and Sandra Huller give sensational performances as the commandant of Auschwitz and his pampered, spoiled wife. The film demands full attention from its audience, as frequently the most important thing happening on screen is happening in the background, or up in the far corner of the frame. We'll see a column of crematorium smoke hovering in the distance, or see some hazy ash floating by as the Nazis wander around their flower garden that they're so proud of.In the film's final moments, we get a glimpse of what might be a conscience in the commandant, a hint that he might not be as utterly indifferent to what he's doing as he appears throughout the rest of the film. It's a haunting scene to cap off a haunting movie.And can I just say that reading about the making of this film makes it all the more impressive. Everything happening on the other side of the concentration camp wall is visual effects projected onto green screens. Now those are the kinds of special effects that really impress me.Grade: A."," Gave Me Chills"
"78","The Zone of Interest","jtindahouse","6/10","6 March 2024","It's rare that I say this but 'The Zone of Interest' is a film where the more you know going in, the more you will likely enjoy it. I always try my best to know as little about a film going in as possible, however I think that really hurt my enjoyment of this film. I kept waiting for a story to develop, for some kind of conflict or plot or just... something. In hindsight I now see what the film was going for and if I had known that I think I would've enjoyed it a lot more (or at least a little more).I had to watch a few explanation videos to fully grasp what they were going for. This is clearly a very intelligent and well thought out piece of cinema, but it certainly isn't going to be for everyone. Watching those explanation videos made me realise that I myself am nowhere near smart enough to fully appreciate a film like this on a single viewing.I think I like the idea of 'The Zone of Interest' more than the actual film itself. This one won't be for everyone, however if you are able to grasp what they're going for and connect with it, I imagine it could be quite a special experience. 6/10."," I like the idea more than the actual film itself"
"79","The Zone of Interest","Lomax343","9/10","20 January 2024","This is one of the most unsettling films I've seen in a very long time. Rudolf Hoess was the Kommandant of Auschwitz, and oversaw the murder of around three million people.At the same time, he was a devoted family man, who lived with his wife and children in a large house just outside the camp. The camp itself is hinted at but not seen. Instead, we see Hoess taking his children on picnics, boating trips and horse rides. His wife and her mother talk about how wonderful the garden is, oblivious to the sound of gun-shots and columns of smoke rising from the crematoria just beyond the garden wall.Christian Friedel's Hoess is nothing like Ralph Feinnes' Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. The latter radiated sadistic evil; the former is terrifyingly normal. He sees the running of a concentration camp as a job and nothing more; a series of practical problems to be overcome through hard work and organisation. The Hoess children seem terrifyingly well-adjusted as well. The worst that can be said of any of them is that one boy can be mean to his younger brother.There's no real plot. The only significant events are Hoess' wife becoming upset because her husband's transfer might lead to her losing her idyllic house and ""idyllic"" lifestyle; and Hoess' later re-appointment to Auschwitz. Thanks to that nice Mr Google, I can reveal that these events took place in November '43 and May '44. The film ends shortly afterwards. We see nothing of Hoess' trial or execution. Just a family man with an odd haircut.It's easy - all too easy, probably - to regard Hoess and his ilk as one-dimensional villains; evil in the way that Bond villains are evil, or Darth Vader is evil. Nothing to do with us at all. The Hoess we see here IS like us. He can oversee the deaths of thousands of people during the day (and off-screen), then come home to read bed-time stories.Nor are Hoess and his ilk firmly in the past. For all I know there are Israeli politicians and leaders of Hamas who think nothing of bombing their perceived enemies, yet who love their children and are loved in return.Towards the end of the film there's a scene shot in the Auschwitz of today - but even here expectations are defied. We see the early-morning cleaning shift arrive before it's opened to visitors. It's a place of horror, but there's still a need to sweep the floors and clean the windows. Why? It's a very human contradiction.The message of the film is simple but profound - and also terrifying. We're ordinary people, but so was Hoess, at least on one level. That thing we call civilisation is a wafer-thin veneer. If we don't look after it, we'll lose it."," The Human Side of a Monster"
"80","The Zone of Interest","TheVictoriousV","9/10","14 February 2024","There exists a series of clips of Adolf Hitler that, to a lot of people, is actually a lot harder to stomach than his enraged speeches and hateful bellows followed by thundering cheers. They show him during his downtime, playing with his kids and charming Eva Braun, acting not altogether unpleasant. As nauseating as the more well-known footage of him may be, there is something singularly disturbing -- even horrifying -- about the reminder that, yes, this monster was in fact human.The Zone of Interest, in a way, does for Holocaust films what that haunting clip does for WW2 footage. There are untold movies about this point in history that are horrific to watch; yet, they are movies we can accept. There is a disconnect between us and the ferocious, clearly evil Nazis. This movie, though it depicts next to no actual barbarity, may go down as the most harrowing of them all.Like Klondike, it is a war film whose horror comes not from images of violence, but from the casual way that violence is treated by those at the center of war, only this time, it is not from the vantage point of traumatized innocents. As Jeff Zhang's review points out, this is not the sort of Holocaust film that puts the atrocities of Nazi Germany in the preferred blunt terms: ""Its acts of evil -- oozing on the periphery of domestic rigamarole -- are designed to needle and splinter in the brain rather than suck the air out of the room: ashes of the dead in the river as nuisance, installing Auschwitz ovens like they're dishwashers, gunshots and wails of anguish heard but not seen...""More precisely, the movie follows a German man as he simply, well, spends time with his loving family at their lovely home -- which, as it happens, is situated right by the walls of one of the deadliest concentration camps of The Third Reich, whose death and suffering are acknowledged only when they ""intrude"" on the family's peace. The man is Rudolf Höss, who was the Auschwitz commandant 1940-1943. One of the biggest stirs in the family is when he learns he may be promoted, possibly forcing them to move.In a genre that often forces us to look into Hell, this movie forces us to remain blind. To be clear, that's not to say that the truth is hidden; we're painfully aware of what's being kept from us as we're put in the comfort in which people sat, and continue to sit, while watching genocide from afar. And it isn't just the audience that Glazer puts into this position:The actors, particularly the leads Christian Fiedel and Sandra Hüller, are eerily convincing and they may have ended up eerily CONVINCED during filming. All but forced to immerse themselves in the lives of the Hösses, they sometimes weren't informed where exactly the cameras were located -- only that certain rooms in the Höss household contained cameras (sometimes they didn't even get to hear which ones). The actors go about the family's routines, presented to us in real time. This Caché-esque cinematography only strengthens the feeling that we're sitting somewhere in the house, watching; hearing what they hear; forced to ignore what they ignore.Basically, this is not akin to such Holocaust dramas as Schindler's List, Son of Saul, or Come and See; however, it isn't quite a film like Shoah either -- a movie that, whereas some would insist that we have a duty to ""depict"" Nazi violence so that it's clear to future generations this mustn't happen again, suggests that it cannot be done, and so relies solely on the words of survivors, letting our minds fill in the rest. In the words of David Ehlrich, The Zone of Interest ""splits the difference between the two opposite modes of its solemn genre""; other reviews view it as a reaction to Godard and Haneke's statements re: Schindler's List, accusing Spielberg of trying to make suffering entertaining.This is indeed a film that sticks in your brain. It leaves us horrified, not that people like the Hösses existed and still exist amongst us, but that the movie may simply be a mirror -- here we sit, in a warm building in comfortable chairs as lives are ended by the day in Palestine, Congo, Sudan, and several others that most of you probably haven't even heard of yet. There is a world of difference between being uninformed and being an SS officer of course, but complicity takes many forms and both types of person are victims of the same propaganda. Now, will you look past the wall?By design, the movie doesn't have the sort of nightmarish visuals we may expect from Glazer; yet, there are shots of dark hallways and other pitch-black images where the darkness seems as alive and all-consuming as the liquid void from Under the Skin. (The music, by Mica Levi, during these moments was succinctly described by a YouTube commenter as ""the Universe mournfully sighing"".) While I recommend seeing the film in theaters -- in a setting where you can truly appreciate the sound design and purposeful imagery -- these particular sequences may work even better at home.On certain screens, when you stare into pitch blackness, you eventually discover your own face in it."," Will you look beyond the wall?"
"81","The Zone of Interest","gortx","9/10","9 January 2024","Director Jonathan Glazer isn't very prolific with only three prior films over the past 23 years, but each is marked by a distinctive vision (SEXY BEAST, BIRTH and UNDER THE SKIN). ZONE OF INTEREST is no different with an even more controlled conception.Loosely adapting Martin Amis' novel, Glazer creates a setting, a tableu, and never lets go. Opening with a long ominous musical overture by Mica Levi the viewer is plunged into a seemingly tranquil German family home. Uniformed Nazi officers are about, served by compliant women. A commandant, Rudolf Hoss (Christian Friedel) returns home to his family including his wife Hedwig (Sandra Huller, superb as she also was in this year's ANATOMY OF A FALL) and five children. Hedwig's mother, Linna (Imogen Kogge) comes to stay with them. Their yard is idyllic save for a high concrete fence that partially masks an industrial looking building just behind it. Auschwitz.Lukasz Zal's (IDA, COLD WAR) camera never moves. The set-ups are often at quite a distance, as if it were all a set-piece on a stage. As officers come and go, the viewer overhears snatches of conversation about how to more efficiently run the camps, Rudolf attententively leads the discussions. Hedwig runs the home, with a determined, yet outwardly calm demeanor. The banality of evil has rarely been depicted with such domesticality. The children play outside as most kids would do, only with a faint everpresent chimny smoke wafting into the sky. There are a couple of departures from the regimented compositions when dark children's fairy tales are depicted as if a camera negative. Levi contributes additional chilling music cues.As placidly chilling as the visuals are Sound Designer Johnnie Burn creates a malevolent maelstrom of audio effects mixing in gunshots, dog barks, mayhem and human voices. Glazer never shows the insides of the camp, yet the sound and visions more than carry his intent. Even more so, since they burrow into the audience's subconscious.Glazer has crafted a movie with a precise, if a bit self-limiting, goal. There are some moments that don't work (particularly late in the film), but one never doubts that it is uniquely his own. For those willing to take the bleak journey, Levi's exit music will haunt one long after it fades out."," Jonathan Glazer's haunting vision"
"82","The Zone of Interest","PotassiumMan","8/10","17 December 2023","This incandescent film portrays the idyllic life that the family of Nazi commandant Rudolf Hoss enjoyed in a sumptuous house right next to the concentration camp in Auschwitz right in the middle of the Holocaust. There is very little soundtrack and it all unfolds at a deliberate pace that is in keeping with Jonathan Glazer's slow-burn, disquieting style. A rigorous sense of order and calm is prevalent throughout.We never actually see any of the Holocaust taking place even though it's right next door. The barbarism and butchery are only apparent from the screams in the distance or from fires at night or smoke during the daytime. The pristine, lush surroundings of this family bely the mass extermination that is taking place in the immediate vicinity. It's a masterful work in which conveys horrible events by leaving them to the imagination.A repeat viewing might be helpful as subtitles in this film are sometimes rapid-fire.

But be warned - if you expect a strong story or plot, you will not get much. Certainly, in a certain sense, the movie's approach to the theme of the Holocaust is thought-provoking, but that's simply not enough for a full length movie - there are some strong pictures and scenes, but observing a family and staff doing their daily routines and stuff just can hold one's attention so far (at least mine) - some scenes are overlong and just bored me a lot. What else? Production and cast are solid on a TV-movie scale. The Zone of Interest reminds me of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas; the latter one is far more suspenseful and entertaining (despite the serious theme), and last but not least, the way better movie.

"85","The Zone of Interest","ergo-58534","9/10","12 July 2023","The Zone of Interest, the latest film by Jonathan Glazer, is a harrowing and disturbing drama that explores the lives of the Nazi commandant of Auschwitz, Rudolf Höss, and his wife Hedwig, who live in a house and garden next to the camp. Based on the novel by Martin Amis, the film is a loose adaptation that uses the real names and testimonies of the people involved in the events, rather than fictionalizing them.The film is a masterful exercise in contrast and tension, as it juxtaposes the mundane and domestic scenes of the Höss family with the horrific and unspeakable atrocities happening just over the wall. Glazer avoids showing graphic violence, but instead uses sound, suggestion and implication to create a sense of dread and horror. The film also challenges the audience to confront the banality and complicity of evil, as it shows how the Hösses rationalize, justify and normalize their actions and roles in the genocide.The film features stunning performances by Sandra Hüller and Christian Friedel as Hedwig and Rudolf Höss, who portray their characters with nuance and complexity. Hüller is especially remarkable as Hedwig, who oscillates between denial, curiosity, guilt and defiance as she grapples with her situation. The film also boasts a remarkable cinematography by Lukasz Zal, who captures the bleak and oppressive atmosphere of Auschwitz with stark and haunting images. The film's score by Mica Levi is equally haunting and unsettling, creating a mood of anxiety and despair.The Zone of Interest is not an easy film to watch, but it is a powerful and important one. It is a film that does not shy away from confronting the darkest aspects of human nature, but also does not exploit or sensationalize them. It is a film that asks difficult questions, but does not offer easy answers. It is a film that will stay with you long after it ends."," A Haunting and Unflinching Portrait of Evil"

Then I realised what it was about.We have arrived at the point where the horror of the Holocaust is so well-known that there is no need to show the inside of the camps anymore. The mere suggestion is enough to imbue the banal with meaning. The Zone of Interest is a bland film and a gruesome audio play in one, twisting everything into a nauseating double-entendre.Cinematographer Lukasz Zal lets a static camera capture wide frames. He deliberately keeps his distance so we, the audience, can observe. This objective point of view is then contrasted with several artistic moments with negative images or monochromatic slates. Such interpretative inserts don't add anything to the film but don't hurt it either. It underlines the horror. However, the soundscapes by composer Mica Levi push this feeling through much more effectively.This film is not for the squeamish, even though there is no gore, only sounds.

Perhaps that's the point, but it didn't hold my interest and got quite tedious and obvious. Nothing wrong on a technical or performance level.

that something is wrong are through sounds, the barking of dogs, the cries of children, shots in the background, and the screams of camp guards.

It takes one minute to understand what the director was aiming for: Show the banality of the everyday life of the family of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Hoss in contrast to the sadistic hell happening only meters away. Ok, we get that in the first few minutes. But then it goes on and on and on. Nothing happens.I'm sorry but this is not good movie making.

"92","The Zone of Interest","CinemaSerf","9/10","23 November 2023","Christian Friedel is quite effective in his portrayal of the Nazi commandant Rudolf Höss here. He and wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) offer us one of the most stark contradictions I think I've ever seen on screen. The beautifully manicured garden of a delightful family home with an unique next door neighbour. That would be the Auschwitz concentration camp of which he was in control. We follow his selection to run the place, his increasing role in implementing the extermination processes and then gradually, as he is promoted again, their realisation that the idyllic life they want for themselves is doomed. It's the brutal comparisons that work best here. We don't really see anything graphic on screen, that's all left to our already well enough developed imagination. The blissful ignorance of their children, the ample supply of food and the prevailing attitudes that nothing at all is amiss compares frighteningly with the real life ghastliness of those just a few feet across a large concrete wall. I suppose it could have more meat on it's bones - maybe just a little too much is left to our own interpretation and it can be a little slow at times, but it still delivers well as a template for just how many people thought the mass killings was hardly more important than whether or not they'd run out of eggs. It's not an history lesson - there are corners cut and licence is certainly taken with some of the timelines, but it's still a poignant look at human behaviour that's well worth a watch."," The Zone of Interest"

Then there are films that are excellent, but you never want to see them again, and they are very hard to recommend.The Zone Of Interest falls into the latter part of that sentence.It's a remarkable film, with a hideous backdrop. The Hoss family are living a subliminal suburban life, with an idyllic house, servants, and the kids have a wonderful education. But, they happen to live right next to Auschwitz.Glazer is a phenomenal film maker, and whilst I didn't like Under The Skin, the guerilla film making in that movie was genius, and here, he puts cameras in different places in the house and turns it to impromptu performance from the cast. Obviously not all of it is impromptu, but it's a Marvel turn from Glazer, and it makes the film feel more real.But then as the film progresses, the background becomes the main character, and much like the Hoss family, there is no getting away from the fact that diabolical things are happening beyond the eye.And this turns the idyllic life for the family into something else. Are they ignorant? Are they Embarrassed? Or are they as monstrous as the beasts that are working in the camp?So, as I've already said, it's a remarkable piece of work, with some shocking sequences (the scene at the river is grotesque), but like Come And See, it's really hard to recommend, and I have no desire to see it again."," The life we enjoy is very much worth the sacrifice....."
"95","The Zone of Interest","SoumikBanerjee1996","4/10","9 March 2024","The medium of 'Cinema' is widely recognized as a means of visual storytelling, where a series of moving images move the narrative forward, with background sound playing a secondary role. However, there are instances where the audio takes control of the sequences and defies conventionality.Jonathan Glazer's ""The Zone of Interest"" serves as a prime example of this phenomenon. The director skilfully employs a variety of sounds, such as the constant arrivals of trains, gunshots, and the burning of chimneys, creating an atmosphere that is undeniably terrifying.Whilst there are a few noteworthy cinematographic elements, including effective use of juxtaposition, it is the background score and sound design that bear the brunt of the storytelling.For those interested in watching this film in the comfort of their homes, I would personally recommend finding the quietest possible environment, utilizing proper sound systems or headphones (preferably noise-canceling ones), and try to watch the entire thing in one sitting, without interruptions.Trust me, this approach will significantly enhance your perception of the film.However, it is important to note that the film heavily relies on visual as well as auditory 'insinuations,' such as suggestive sounds and framings, to convey its message. As a result, individuals who are might be unfamiliar with historical events, particularly those lacking knowledge of ""The Holocaust,"" may struggle to grasp these subtleties.In essence, it is not a readily accessible feature for all viewers out there.

"96","The Zone of Interest","Stay_away_from_the_Metropol","6/10","12 January 2024","As a huge fan of director Jonathan Glazer's other 3 films, the fact that I found very little to enjoy about this film was disappointing on an astonishing level. I would say that Under The Skin is one of the greatest films of this century, while Birth is one of the more underrated, but my jaw dropped and I said ""no way"" out loud when this one ended because I couldn't believe it - there wasn't one single sequence or element that made this movie worth the watch.The very obvious strengths were the photography, the environments, and Mica Levi's creepy music contributions, but those were definitely not enough to make the full viewing feel worthwhile. I was hardly able to view this as a movie at all. The characters were so bland they were almost not characters at all. The story hardly moves. Just as it begins going somewhere, the film is over. Obviously, considering the environment, the dialogue probably needs to be cold and sterile, and it is, but it is also immensely boring all the way through. And, outside of observing the beautiful painting-like shots, the film gives you nothing else outside of a few looming metaphors and a couple of matching short surrealist sequences.I don't have much else to say, other than I can't understand what all the rave reviews are about. Maybe these people are all also fans of Tarkovsky's STALKER, which is one of my least favorite celebrated films of all time - it was reminding me of that on occasion. I wanted to love this, but I didn't even like it.

"97","The Zone of Interest","garethcrook","5/10","21 February 2024","Coming off watching Claude Lanzmann's 9 hour documentary on the Holocaust, Shoah, I'm not sure how I'll take to The Zone of Interest. First of all this is dramatic, cinematic and stylish. All things that feel a bit fluffy with a part of history like this, but hang on. The same could be said of Schindler's List and that worked rather well. A dissident ambient score softly introduces a young German family, enjoying the countryside on a fine day as a slow discomforting rumble takes over. Scenes of idyllic family life, slowly interrupted by glimpses of razor wire and lookout towers. For this family live next door to Auschwitz. Where the father, Rudolph Höss (Christian Friedel) murders Jews. It's unnerving to watch as the family get gifts of new clothes and food, clearly taken from those recently gassed and burned. Each scene held under a kind of stark microscope, with the camera locked off like Roy Andersson film. The children reenact executions with toy soldiers and proudly wear the uniform of the Hitler youth. The point is, they're all evil 'bar stewards' really iMDB, a little profanity is sometimes warranted), keeping their hands clean, pretending some faux sophistication. In a picture perfect world they've created, whilst ignoring the horrors that we can only hear on the other side of the camp wall. That is until Höss finds out that although he's powerful in this fabrication, it's only that. On finding out they're to be transferred, his wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) is not best pleased. For she thinks they live in paradise. It's unclear what this film is trying to say. It tells a different side of the story and although it doesn't glorify it, it's doesn't exactly condemn it either. It feels almost eerily indifferent. Soulless. Heartless. Like the people it portrays. It's an odd film, not one that I can say I enjoyed, although it has something about it. It just struggles under the weight of its history, which is perhaps why the jarring final scenes of present day Auschwitz are tagged on in a surreal twist. It's beautifully shot though and the sound design is fantastic."," Soulless but stylish."
"98","The Zone of Interest","meganj-23247","10/10","6 February 2024","First of all this film is provocative and poignant - but this could just be a result of the subject matter alone without Glazer's film. The performances are excellent and I actually enjoyed the ""kitchen sink"" drama displayed. However, this does mean the film might be considered boring or slow because there is little in the way of actual plot. Really the story consists of Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel), a Nazi commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp, who lives beside the camp with his family and his wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) who becomes upset when told he (and subsequently the family) might be transferred. The horror of the Holocaust and the crimes taking place within Auschwitz are never shown on screen, instead the sounds associated with the death and torture of the camp are only ever heard over the wall dividing the Höss family home (and garden) and Auschwitz.For this review, I was going to write about the final scene(s) because I think it's something that might divide those who like/dislike The Zone of Interest. Rudolf Hoss is back in Germany, I think, and meeting with his Nazi superiors to receive orders regarding his future in the party and employment. He is informed that he has being doing ""a good job"" and thus returning to his position at Auschwitz to oversee the arrival of many Hungarian Jews. The operation is given the name ""operation Höss"" and when Rudolf phones his wife to tell her, he is clearly very proud of the fact this will be his namesake. He then is witnessed, soon after, heading down the stairs to leave (presumably to return to Auschwitz). As he defends the stairs (of ann empty grand building) into ever increasing darkness, he stops several times as if he is about to throw up. I'm conflicted as to what this is portraying, as because until now, neither of the two main characters of Rudolf and Hedwig have shown any remorse for their actions or complicity, and so perhaps this is indeed Glazer's attempt to show Rudolf does have some remorse about his own role in the horrific Holocaust. He then stops and looks at a dark corridor where a small circle of white light is seen. The audience are then transitioned to modern day, in a jarring juxtaposition, where workers at the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum are seen opening the gates, and then cleaning, sweeping and vacuuming the floors and displays. Now, I understand that some people have taken this scene to demonstrate the true cost of what was occurring over the wall and within the confinements of the Auschwitz concentration camp because the displays show the incinerators, the empty gas chambers, and the possessions of the Jewish prisoners piled high in disregard by the Nazi's at the time. It is somber and startling because if, indeed, there is an audience to 'The Zone of Interest' who does not know what happened at Auschwitz then this is the film's chance to finally show this. However, if this was Glazer's intention alone then there is no need for him to show the displays etc alongside the cleaners going about their work.I think Glazer intentionally includes the cleaners and staff almost in an accusatory way to us as spectators of the film, visitors or ""tourists"" off Auschwitz and wider (and current) events occurring in the world. The theme of The Zone of Interest is exposing the ""banality of evil"" and in this regard, this scene serves to further this point to us. As the cleaners go about their work, they inevitably will become desensitised to their surroundings, particularly if they are working there daily, and this is not their fault. But then is Glazer asking whether Auschwitz again has become a place of banality or mundanity? Secondly, another reading of this sense, that I instantly took after seeing the film, was that instead of the museum being a place of memoralisation and reflection to those who suffered and died, is it actually in danger of us just giving evil people like Rudolf Hoss a legacy? As Rudolf looks on to, as suggested, visualise these modern day museum scenes, is he proud that we still visit it and disturbingly awe (even if in disgust) at his ""work""? Much in the same way he is proud of the operation of the Hungarian Jews being named after him? It's a difficult feeling to contend with as a viewer, and if this is the case, I don't think Glazer is saying we are doing it willingly or with a conscious evil intent, but then isn't this part of history of the holocaust, in that many people knew something was going on but they chose not to think too deeply or it was too far away, or it was too hard to stop and control under the threat of brutal authoritarianism.This is why I actually think the final scene saves the film, and ensures that Glazer has something new to say and add to a plethora of Holocaust artefacts, literature and film. But the film as whole is also teetering the line of boredom, being too symbolic and ""artsy"" for the sake of it, and thinking it is cleverer than it is when actually it is more overt than it is would like. Therefore I'm in the middle and can only give the film a 5/10."," A comment on the final scene(s)"
"99","The Zone of Interest","RussHog","10/10","27 January 2024","This film caught my eye because it was nominated for best picture and the trailer was intriguing. Always been a bit of a WW2 buff, and have read many books about the rise and fall of Nazi Germany. Having seen this, I don't know if I've ever seen a film that more captures the madness and evil of Nazi Germany - but also a cautionary tale of people who keep silent while atrocities are being committed.This is the real life story of the Commandant of Auschwitz, who perfected the Final Solution for Adolf Hitler, and how kills several thousand people a day. He lives in a home connected to the wall of the camp, as he tries to keep his family together when he is transferred to another job. The wife refuses to go and so our anti-hero goes about his duty while using the bureaucracy of the Nazi machine to keep his wife in their home.Most of this film is just people going about life as normal. Servants set up the house. Neighbors and family come to visit. Kids play. Dogs bark. But, in the BG, the sounds of the Auschwitz camp haunt the land. At night, most people in the film are traumatized in one way shape or form by the camp...the kids begin to mistreat one another, the daughter sleepwalks, the neighbors are bothered by the ash.Most eerie of all is that this is all true stuff. This family really existed. The Commandant was known to be soft and gentle with his kids.

"100","The Zone of Interest","SteverB",NA,"2 March 2024","I have been looking forward to ""The Zone of Interest"" since I first heard about it, and was NOT disappointed, either by the film or its direction by Jonathan Glazer. After watching, I came here to rate, and maybe review, but got caught up in reading others' reviews. After reading 40 or 50 of them in whatever order IMDb defaults to, I'd made a decision about my rating.This film is incredibly difficult to rate. On the one hand, it is a portrait of the commandant of Auschwitz and his family, living in their home just this side of the wall separating ""normal"" German life from one of the most prolific deathcamps of Nazi Germany. On the other hand, it is also a film about the (can't think of a better word) banality of that family's life, while living next door to Auschwitz. And their lives are banal, just like most of our lives are banal. We get up in the morning, brush our teeth, eat breakfast, go to work, come home, have dinner, watch TV, or in the case of 1940s Germany, read books, and talk to our spouses before going to sleep, and starting it all over the next day. It's mostly boring, and it's certainly boring to WATCH it happen. BUT none of us LIVE NEXT DOOR TO AUSCHWITZ!THAT was the thought that kept me glued to this film from start to finish. Whatever this family did in its everyday, boring, banal existence, they live next door to Auschwitz, and they are so inured to it, that they don't even notice, except when some elements become either a ""prize"" for the family like a fur coat for the wife or some new teeth for a son's collection, or a problem, like human cremains in the river, or unwanted ash in the garden.After about 45 minutes of this film, I realized that the film is best at being claustrophobic. The viewer is trapped in this place with this insane bunch of people. Everything has a wall around it, or a locked door, or a light that is being turned off, or nighttime scenes that make little sense, but add to the feeling of being inside one of those nightmares where you can't find your way out. And another reviewer focused on the dog, Dilla. The dog knew what was going on and was aware of everything, all the time. Agitated, always agitated.I've seen reviews here calling the film boring, or slow, or having no plot, and I have to agree; the film is slow, boring, and has very little plot, and that's the point. The ""banality of evil"" is exactly what it says -- banal. Banal is slow, boring and has no plot because that's what it is. In exactly the same way as our own individual lives are banal, so were the lives of the people depicted in this film, BUT the big difference is not only did they live where they lived, but DAD was in charge of the mechanics of the millions of murders taking place just on the other side of their garden wall. THAT is the evilest aspect of the film and the story. This film will stay with me for a long time. I highly recommend it."," Claustrophobic"

Second, I found it very confusing how the main characters knew who the bad guy was just by looking at one picture of him without his suit on. They just saw the guy and were like ""oh that's him."" I personally loved the way they showed off madame webs powers and the potential she has. I also thought it was neat how we got to see Ben Parker at the time he found out he was going to be an uncle.

If you are going to watch this save your money, I have never been more bored in my life, tickets were decent price however when I got into the cinema it was me, my friend and one other person that says more than I need to that's how boring this monstrosity of a film was. There was no story behind the 30mins I watched, it was basically a run of knock of Spider-Man but on a budget, production could have made this film better, once again save your money and time and don't bother watching this film."," So boring"

"108","Madame Web","dkhwnzf","2/10","20 February 2024","Madam Web, a character in the Marvel Comics universe, fails to captivate audiences with her lackluster and uninspiring presence. Introduced as a clairvoyant with ties to the mystical, her potential is squandered by inconsistent storytelling and a failure to establish a compelling narrative around her.One of the primary issues with Madam Web is the ambiguity surrounding her origins and powers. Instead of providing a clear and engaging backstory, the character is shrouded in mystery to the point of confusion. This lack of development leaves audiences detached, struggling to invest in a character that remains enigmatic without purpose.Furthermore, Madam Web's role within the Marvel universe feels forced and inconsequential. Despite being positioned as a key figure, she often comes across as a mere plot device rather than a fully fleshed-out character with agency and depth. The narrative fails to explore her potential impact on the larger Marvel landscape, rendering her existence seemingly arbitrary.The character's visual representation also falls short of expectations. Madam Web's design lacks the creativity and distinctiveness that define iconic Marvel characters. Her costume and appearance feel generic, failing to leave a lasting visual impression that would make her stand out among the plethora of superheroes and villains within the Marvel universe.Narratively, Madam Web's involvement in various story arcs often feels like an afterthought. Writers struggle to integrate her seamlessly into overarching plots, leading to disjointed storytelling that detracts from the overall cohesion of the comic series. This lack of narrative integration leaves Madam Web feeling like a superfluous addition rather than a meaningful contribution to the Marvel mythos.Moreover, Madam Web's powers, centered around precognition, become a repetitive narrative device. The constant reliance on her ability to foresee events diminishes the element of surprise and suspense in the storytelling, making her appearances predictable and, ultimately, monotonous."," Sony dropped the ball again."

The actor that played the villain lacked substance and his backstory wasn't told well. I couldn't really workout why he was doing what he was doing.The rest of the cast was good.

But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching.

Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring.

You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark.

Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION.

I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels."," So bad it's good, or so bad it's bad? You decide"
"135","Madame Web","ethanbresnett","3/10","21 February 2024","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time."," A massive waste of time"
"136","Madame Web","sinscopefilms","3/10","15 February 2024","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10."," I regret watching this film"
"137","Madame Web","eddie_baggins","1/10","22 February 2024","I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"," An all-time disasterpiece"
"138","Madame Web","movieman6-413-929510","2/10","17 February 2024","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series."," Writers produce messy, tired work without really knowing what to do with it."
"139","Madame Web","MiroslavKyuranov","4/10","14 February 2024","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago."," Fifty Shades Of Mess"
"140","Madame Web","darrelltill","1/10","15 February 2024","There is nothing good in this film. It's badly written - not just full of clichés but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like cliché superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent."," Madame Pleb"
"141","Madame Web","vengeance20","2/10","20 February 2024","Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10."," It's Bad."
"142","Madame Web","isaacsundaralingam","1/10","19 February 2024","Yea, this was garbage and that's saying plenty. It's actually adorable how little anyone cared about ""Madame Web"" - not just the audience, but the filmmakers and actors themselves. Written by the same people who wrote ""Morbius"", this movie is yet another reason to not let them anywhere near a writing software ever again.Not only was the movie unwatchable due to how lifeless it was, but it was also criminally boring. You're waiting for something to happen and you keep waiting right until the credits start to roll. Nothing about the movie was compelling, the plot was riddled with plot holes, the screenplay was lazy, the dialogues were dead and the acting was almost as if the actors were held captive and being forced to act as if everything was okay. It reeks of corporate greed and there isn't a single positive thing to say about this movie.We're only a month and half into the year and we already have a very strong contender for what might be the worst movie of the year, and it's not even close.

"143","Madame Web","vfphvnpp","2/10","14 February 2024","I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend."," Badly made, weird film"
"144","Madame Web","alindsayal","1/10","16 February 2024","With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10."," One of the worst Comic Book Films Ever"
"145","Madame Web","seven-johnson","1/10","15 February 2024","Finally, a film, cast, Director and studio ready to nail the coffin shut on the superhero-cash-cow ""genre"" and they tackle the challenge with gusto.There was possibly a director, although you might not know it if you've watched the film and could easily just assume this was al AI-algorithm, apparently that directors done other film that I would try to avoid, but I can't remember their name.There's nepo-baby Johnson and absolute personality vacuum - but she's perfected her acting chops since 50 Shades... so, completely wooden and forgettable. Token black girl and token latin girl and Sidney Sweeney - she's the eye-candy, sadly not an actress too though, she'd probably be a great promo-girl for an owl-sounding food chain, but she's out of her depth in everything I've seen her in.CGI which... should have been better even if it came out a decade ago.There's a villain - Ezekiel, at least poignant timing for the etymology of that name and that's it really.There's some explosions and other loud noises, but whilst being the best thing about this stinker, they're also ""retro""/would have been ""ok"" a decade ago.I for one welcome our new AI overlords, at least it can't make films worse than this."," Masterpiece!!!"

"147","Madame Web","rgkarim","5/10","15 February 2024","LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying déjà vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are cliché, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it. Should one see it in theaters? Not really. A shot at home, I would say sure, but with all of this, my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0."," A Messy Web Of Mediocrity"
"148","Madame Web","jared-25331","1/10","17 February 2024","This movie was doomed after the atrocious trailer & I've been waiting to watch this movie, just so that I can move on with my life. And after watching the movie, I can safely agree with everyone who says that this is the worst theatrical released Superhero and Comic Book Movie ever made & I'm only saying this because I watched Spider-Man: Lotus last year & that movie was even worse than this movie, but that doesn't make it any better.Everything about the filmmaking in this movie is some of the worst that I've ever seen in my life & I've seen Jeepers Creepers: Reborn (2022). The camerawork is absolutely amateurish & the edit is abysmal, where they constantly use zooms at random point throughout the runtime. The acting is atrocious from everyone, which hurts because this movie has a lot of great actors including Dakota Johnson, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Celeste O'Connor, Isabela Merced, & Sydney Sweeney. Then again, it doesn't help that their dialogue is among some of the worst put onto screen, especially given the fact that the two writers of this movie are the same writers of Morbius (2022). The villain of this movie, played by Tahar Rahim who looks like Jeremy Jahns from YouTube, is the worst villain in any Superhero & Comic Book Movie or TV Show that I've ever seen. With all that being said I'm going to be spoiling major plot points in this movie from this point on in my review.SPOILER WARNING: To anyone who saw the marketing for this movie, that scene with all the Spider-Woman kicking Ezekiel Sims' butt, yeah that scene last for about 50 seconds & it's all takes place in a premonition that happens within first 19 minutes of this movie. This movie takes place in 2003, so this movie is basically set within the same timeline as Tom Holland's Spider-Man from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but Sony chose to cut out any & all references to Spider-Man & Peter Parker from this movie.In conclusion, Madame Web (2024) is one of the most cynical & abysmal movies that I've ever seen in my life. I feel terrible for a lot of these actors, because I like a lot of them, especially Sydney Sweeney, none of them deserve to have this movie in their filmography. Sony should be ashamed of themselves for making this movie & at this point Kevin Fiege & Marvel Studios need to take the Spider-Man rights away from Sony, because they clearly can't handle having Spider-Man or any other Superhero if we're being honest with ourselves."," WORST THEATRICAL RELEASED SUPERHERO & COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER!!!!!"

My nephew said his spider senses were tingling once we arrived at the theater telling him this movie will be worse than we thought.He was right.This is incompetence at another level.

The same thing even happens twice where he terrorizes the girls and the main chick hits him with the car.Everyone is insufferable and nobody is likeable.

"152","Code 8","stevenrotherforth","8/10","17 January 2020","Code 8It is obvious that this Indie Sci-Fi from Director Jeff Chan takes inspiration from the X Men franchise but it also has a Neill Blomkamp vibe.
Set in a world where some humans have extraordinary gifts.
These powered individuals live in poverty. Their gifts are more of a burden and anyone caught using their special abilities must answer to the law.
A powered construction worker played by Robbie Amell falls in with a criminal gang when he desperately needs to raise money for his sick mother.As aforementioned this film is heavily influenced by the X Men movies but it does have its own unique premise.
Sadly the execution of this premise is slightly lacking.
Performances by all are commendable. The audience will grow to care for what happens to those onscreen due to some decent acting.
However this story would have been better told as a TV series rather than a 1hr 38min movie.
The world which is created onscreen is one that can be expanded upon.
An episodic TV show would have allowed the created universe and characters to flourish.
I have read somewhere that Robbie and Co-star Stephen Amell are actually developing a continuation for the small screen.Considering that this films production budget was crowd funded and was only a measly $2.1 million the special effects are really quite impressive.
This is where the Neill Blomkamp vibe becomes apparent.
The robotic police officers in the movie reminded me of the robot designs in 'Elysium' or perhaps 'Chappie'.
But it is painfully obvious that it is just a man in a suit rather than a CGI creation.
This is where budget constraints are visible.
Still the aerial shots of the drones deploying the robots was rather cool.
This is a film that does punch above its weight in terms of the visuals effects.'Code 8' is certainly worth checking out. It's probably a movie that won't linger in the memory banks for long but the expansion of the universe created by this film in the form of a TV show would be most welcome."," Would have worked better as a TV show."

While presenting a story consisting of rather familiar arcs and themes, it's still packed tightly and driven forward by decent characters, good acting & well done special FX. It reminded me of the very recent indie feature ""Freaks"" - both of these movies deal with the x-men-esque story about humans with abilities & their trials and tribulations in the common world. Both movies are solid.""Code 8"" is a tale about Connor Reed (Robbie Amell), a man with certain abilities, living in a world where people like him are being suppressed. The desperation created by the circumstances around him drive him to risk his life and safety to make money, and so the many endeavours ensue. As I previously mentioned, the story is built of arcs and themes which are routine enough, but ""Code 8"" has a lot to compensate with. For starters, the (also familiar) characters are delivered by a cast of great actors, including the Amell cousins, Greg Byrk as the villain, Sunk Kang - whom I hadn't seen for a long time, and a likely overlooked performance by Kyla Kane. The most valued possession of ""Code 8"" is probably the special FX, cinematography and production design. For a movie of this budget it looks admirably awesome, the style is on-point and contained, no overkills, no on-the-noise cheap frames or visual solutions, might as well be a big-screen flick. Sound design's up there as well.""Code 8"" is like a humbler, more focused indie ""X-men"", a solid directional effort in the sci-fi genre that's not by any means flawless, but delivers most of what it promises. Personally, the one thing I disliked the most was the too conventional type of ending, a more extra ordinary last note would've been nice. I recommend ""Code 8"" to all the sci-fi lovers out there.

"188","Code 8","mualaabo","9/10","18 July 2020","What would you do if your mom had cancer that is curable by chemotherapy, but you can't afford it since you're so poor because you belong to a minority that is being extremely discriminated in the country you live in? The movie is about normal people like you and me who life and society push them to their limits. The movie about our social structure and the movie shows how our actions to our fellow citizens lead to the birth of criminals. Nobody wants to be a criminal, but when you smash people to their limits they will fight back. the movie is 90min of pure entertainment. No unnecessary scenes, no cheap romance. Only emotions that will make you think twice about the society that we live in. The acting was also on point."," It's not about superpowers and it's magnificent!"
"189","Code 8","bluebarracudas","5/10","29 July 2020","The protag does all this hard work and still his mouth is filled with the bitter ash of failure. Meanwhile the drug addict side character who does nothing the whole movie gets a happy ending? Don't waste your time watching after the the scumbag drug lord dies. It's just gonna leave a bad taste in your mouth."," Good movie. Terrible ending."
"190","Code 8","sanmit-ds","8/10","21 April 2020","They took a story and did a good job telling it. Definitely a hidden Netflix gem."," Pretty well done movie"
"191","Code 8","onnekasv","10/10","21 April 2020","One of the best science fiction movies that are out there. They REALLY delivered. Very good job guys."," Amazing"
"192","Code 8","loftylue","5/10","23 January 2020","I can't fairly review it because I only watched 15 mins or so. I was really excited to see this movie but have a low tolerance for bad language. Right away this movie had too many F words.
In my opinion any movie that swears more then a few times the writer isn't doing his job well. It makes a good movie/actors sound like uneducated garbage."," I was excited to watch but too many F words"
"193","Code 8","jelpattison","4/10","21 April 2020","Never achieves what the short did.Decent at best acting, pretty cool world building, awful plot, even worse ending. Not sure what the posi-reviews are about. Very generic. The Guardians were useless fodder. It's still admirable to have achieved the effects they did on the budget they had but those efforts don't paper the cracks of a totally average no-brains superhero romp set in a society that could never exist even within the rules they set themselves.Nice design but ultimately a totally forgettable film."," Disappointing."

"195","Code 8","deiopei-43430","9/10","14 March 2024","At its core, it's a good story with the added sco-fi layer on top. It definitely doesn't have the pace and typical ending of American movies, which is why I'm giving it a high rating. I'm also giving it a high rating because I'm not comparing this movie to any big blockbuster film. If you prefer an action movie with a sci-fi twist, you'll probably enjoy Code 8. If I wasn't biased, I would say it's a 7/10 because some of the film is predictable. However, it's not leaning on big names to carry the story, so I can actually focus on the story instead of critiquing acting, script and plot in my head. I also don't think this is ana adaptation, and it feels fresh, in that respect. I don't have to invest my time learning the ins and outs of the characters. The characters through clearly in 90 minutes, which is a big plus, considering movies can stretch to 3 hours with not much going on. I look forward to seeing the sequel. I feel like this movie is also relevant today with the fast moving pace of AI, and robots with AI technology. What will become of us?"," A very accessible sci-fi film with good effects"
"196","Code 8","christianglong","10/10","13 April 2020","The same people down voting this movie for violence are the same ones who let their kids play GTAV and scream at the teachers."," Hypocrisy"
"197","Code 8","stefanknezovic","6/10","23 April 2020","Brilliant for what it is, most of the time you can't really tell that it's a low budget production. Though by no means a district 9 it's really not bad, definitely warrants a second watch."," Brilliant for a low budget film"
"198","Code 8","blazerosecasting","10/10","8 December 2019","Best movie I've seen in a long time! Robbie is my favorite!"," Unbelievable"
"199","Code 8","helix-40605","9/10","13 December 2019","Definitely a recommended movie to watch. I am personally a big fan of the amells and therefore might be a bit biased, but regardless this was a great movie. I really hope that this movie gets a sequal because I personally think that there is room for 1 or 2 more movies."," Great Movie, Great Actors, Great Effort"
"200","Code 8","coalmaiden","8/10","17 April 2020","Amazing. In another word, dauntless. When a crowd-funded campaign for a different kind of super hero movie that couldn't, this movie was a chore to bring to light the one that could. If you have any doubts about this movie, I can only say this..it's a pretty accurate vision of the future, (if you take away the super powers stuff.) Stare into the abyss, I dare you!! 8/10"," When a sci-fi short SHOULD be a movie"
